**Objectives** 

* to assess the level and trend of loss to follow up from ART programs in the top 13 African countries with high HIV prevelance

To narrow, our previous objective we could just consider only one of the previous objectives. 

The impact of loss to follow up (dropout) to the HIV epidemic is affected by three things

   a) HIV progression (biology) after quiting ART
   
   b) Sexual behaviour of individuals
   
   c) How long individuals stay without re-initiating ART
   
We know that few countries have already revised ART initiation criteria. Studying loss to follow up seems vital to understand the dynamics of HIV in the era of ART scale up. If we don't achieve high retention at treatment programs, it is unlikely to see significant reduction of key epidemic indicators such as incidence and mortality. 

The second interesting aspect, though is the treatment failure aspect. This will be less priority if we decide to have to focus only one.  

* What is the level of first-line treatment failure in African countries? 
* How many of those who failed start second-line treatment immediately? 

Suppose we have efficient managment method to handle first-line treatment and hence individuals are put on second-line immediately after failure. Here, what would be more interesting is the cost of ART programs as second-line ART is more expensive. In resource limited countries like Africa, understanding the level of treatment failure is very important. 

Previous questions (during proposal) 
--------- 

* What is the level of first line treatment failure and HIV drug-resistance in the southern Africa?
* What is the level and trend of treatment dropout rates from HIV treatment programs?
