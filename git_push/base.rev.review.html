<p>Efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy versus nevirapine-including regimens for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV option B plus in resource-limited settings: is there anything missing? <strong>Expert review of anti-infective therapy</strong> <em>De Nardo P Gentilotti E Nguhuni B Vairo F Chaula Z Nicastri E Ippolito G</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26559430">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>In 2013, an estimated 1.5 million HIV-positive pregnant women gave birth, with 240,000 children worldwide acquiring HIV. More than 90% of new pediatric infections occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa. The latest WHO guidelines recommended efavirenz (EFV)-based antiretroviral therapy as the first-line regimen for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). On the other hand, some data suggest that nevirapine (NVP), a well-known antiretroviral, could still play a relevant role in PMTCT, especially in resource-limited settings (RLSs) where the fertility rate is dramatically high compared to developed countries. Given the lack of an unanimous consensus and definitive opinions, this paper goes through the reasons for WHO decisions and aims at refreshing the debate about NVP and EFV pros and cons for PMTCT in RLSs.</p>

<p>Elimination of Mother-To-Child Transmission of HIV Infection: The Drug Resource Enhancement against AIDS and Malnutrition Model. <strong>International journal of environmental research and public health</strong> <em>Liotta G Marazzi MC Mothibi KE Zimba I Amangoua EE Bonje EK Bossiky BN Robinson PA Scarcella P Musokotwane K Palombi L Germano P Narciso P de Luca A Alumando E Mamary SH Magid NA Guidotti G Mancinelli S Orlando S Peroni M Buonomo E Nielsen-Saines K</em></p>

<p>The Drug Resource Enhancement against AIDS and Malnutrition Program (DREAM) gathered professionals in the field of Elimination of HIV-Mother-To-Child Transmission (EMTCT) in Maputo in 2013 to discuss obstacles and solutions for the elimination of HIV vertical transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. During this workshop, the benefits of administrating combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) to HIV positive women from pregnancy throughout breastfeeding were reviewed. cART is capable of reducing vertical transmission to less than 5% at 24 months of age, as well as maternal mortality and infant mortality in both HIV infected and exposed populations to levels similar to those of uninfected individuals. The challenge for programs targeting eMTCT in developing countries is retention in care and treatment adherence. Both are intrinsically related to the model of care. The drop-out from eMTCT programs before cART initiation ranges from 33%-88% while retention rates at 18-24 months are less than 50%. Comprehensive strategies including peer-to-peer education, social support and laboratory monitoring can reduce refusals to less than 5% and attain retention rates approaching 90%. Several components of the model of care for reduction of HIV-1 MTCT are feasible and implementable in scale-up strategies. A review of this model of care for HIV eMTCT is provided.</p>

<p>Retention of Adult Patients on Antiretroviral Therapy in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis 2008-2013. <strong>Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999)</strong> <em>Fox MP Rosen S</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25942461">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>BACKGROUND: We previously published systematic reviews of retention in care after antiretroviral therapy initiation among general adult populations in sub-Saharan Africa. We estimated 36-month retention at 73% for publications from 2007 to 2010. This report extends the review to cover 2008-2013 and expands it to all low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Register, and ISI Web of Science from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2013, and abstracts from AIDS and IAS from 2008-2013. We estimated retention across cohorts using simple averages and interpolated missing times through the last time reported. We estimated all-cause attrition (death, loss to follow-up) for patients receiving first-line antiretroviral therapy in routine settings in low- and middle-income countries. RESULTS: We found 123 articles and abstracts reporting retention for 154 patient cohorts and 1,554,773 patients in 42 countries. Overall, 43% of all patients not retained were known to have died. Unweighted averages of reported retention were 78%, 71%, and 69% at 12, 24, and 36 months, after treatment initiation, respectively. We estimated 36-month retention at 65% in Africa, 80% in Asia, and 64% in Latin America and the Caribbean. From lifetable analysis, we estimated retention at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months at 83%, 74%, 68%, 64%, and 60%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Retention at 36 months on treatment averages 65%-70%. There are several important gaps in the evidence base, which could be filled by further research, especially in terms of geographic coverage and duration of follow-up.</p>

<p>Transplantation in resource-limited setting: using HIV-positive donors for HIV-positive patients. <strong>Clinical nephrology</strong> <em>Muller E</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25725240">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>BACKGROUND: A HIV positive-to-positive program was started in South Africa in 2008. The program was started because dialysis is not freely available to everyone, but severely limited and only available to a selected group of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 2008 and March 2015, 29 patients were transplanted from HIV-positive brain-dead donors at Groote Schuur Hospital transplant team. Donors were either naive to anti-retroviral therapy or on first line therapy. The recipients were selected to have undetectable plasma HIV type 1 RNA levels and be on a stable antiretroviral regimen. CD4+ T-cell counts of at least 200/mm3 in last 6 months prior to transplant, with no previous serious opportunistic infections. RESULTS: Survivors in the study were followed for a median of 2.4 years. The rate of patient survival was 84% at 1 year and 74% at 5 years. The corresponding graft survival rate was 93% and 84%. CONCLUSION: Using HIV-positive donors might resolve some of the problems we are experiencing in getting enough donors for our patients wit ESRD. In the USA the HOPE act was accepted in 2014 and this might now also impact on the use of HIV positive donors elsewhere in the world.</p>

<p>Inpatient mortality of HIV-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa and possible interventions: a mixed methods review. <strong>BMC health services research</strong> <em>Wajanga BM Webster LE Peck RN Downs JA Mate K Smart LR Fitzgerald DW</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25465206">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Despite the increased availability of anti-retroviral therapy, in-hospital HIV mortality remains high in sub-Saharan Africa. Reports from Senegal, Malawi, and Tanzania show rates of in-hospital, HIV-related mortality ranging from 24.2% to 44%. This mixed methods review explored the potential causes of preventable in-hospital mortality associated with HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa in the anti-retroviral era. RESULTS: Based on our experience as healthcare providers in Africa and a review of the literature we identified 5 health systems failures which may cause preventable in-hospital mortality, including: 1) late presentation of HIV cases, 2) low rates of in-hospital HIV testing, 3) poor laboratory capacity which limits CD4 T-cell testing and the diagnosis of opportunistic infections, 4) delay in initiation of anti-retroviral therapy in-hospital, and 5) problems associated with loss to follow-up upon discharge from hospital. CONCLUSION: Our findings, together with the current available literature, should be used to develop practical interventions that can be implemented to reduce in-hospital mortality.</p>

<p>Self-transfer and mortality amongst adults lost to follow-up in ART programmes in low- and middle-income countries: systematic review and meta-analysis. <strong>Tropical medicine &amp; international health : TM &amp; IH</strong> <em>Wilkinson LS Skordis-Worrall J Ajose O Ford N</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25418366">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: To ascertain estimates of adult patients, recorded as lost to follow-up (LTFU) within antiretroviral treatment (ART) programmes, who have self-transferred care, died or truly stopped ART in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Science Direct, LILACS, IndMed and AIM databases (2003-2013) and IAS/AIDS conference abstracts (2011-2013) were searched for tracing studies reporting the proportion of traced patients found to have self-transferred, died or stopped ART. These estimates were then combined using random-effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias was assessed through subgroup and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Twenty eight studies were eligible for inclusion, reporting true outcomes for 10,806 traced patients attending approximately 258 ART facilities. None were from outside sub-Saharan Africa. Twenty three studies reported 4.5-54.4% traced LTFU patients self-transferring care, providing a pooled estimate of 18.6% (95% CI 15.8-22.0%). A significant positive association was found between rates of self-transfer and LTFU in the ART cohort. The pooled estimates for unreported deaths were 38.8% (95% CI 30.8-46.8%; 27 studies) and 28.6% (95% CI 21.9-36.0%; 20 studies) for patients stopping ART. A significant decrease in unreported deaths from 50.0% (95% CI 41.5-58.4%) to 30.0% (95% CI 21.1-38.9%) was found comparing study periods before and after 31 December 2007. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial unaccounted for transfers and deaths amongst patients LTFU confirms that retention and mortality is underestimated where the true outcomes of LTFU patients are not ascertained.</p>

<p>A systematic review of individual and contextual factors affecting ART initiation, adherence, and retention for HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women. <strong>PloS one</strong> <em>Hodgson I Plummer ML Konopka SN Colvin CJ Jonas E Albertini J Amzel A Fogg KP</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25372479">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Despite progress reducing maternal mortality, HIV-related maternal deaths remain high, accounting, for example, for up to 24 percent of all pregnancy-related deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is effective in improving outcomes among HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women, yet rates of initiation, adherence, and retention remain low. This systematic literature review synthesized evidence about individual and contextual factors affecting ART use among HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women. METHODS: Searches were conducted for studies addressing the population (HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women), intervention (ART), and outcomes of interest (initiation, adherence, and retention). Quantitative and qualitative studies published in English since January 2008 were included. Individual and contextual enablers and barriers to ART use were extracted and organized thematically within a framework of individual, interpersonal, community, and structural categories. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies were included in the review. Individual-level factors included both those within and outside a woman's awareness and control (e.g., commitment to child's health or age). Individual-level barriers included poor understanding of HIV, ART, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and difficulty managing practical demands of ART. At an interpersonal level, disclosure to a spouse and spousal involvement in treatment were associated with improved initiation, adherence, and retention. Fear of negative consequences was a barrier to disclosure. At a community level, stigma was a major barrier. Key structural barriers and enablers were related to health system use and engagement, including access to services and health worker attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: To be successful, programs seeking to expand access to and continued use of ART by integrating maternal health and HIV services must identify and address the relevant barriers and enablers in their own context that are described in this review. Further research on this population, including those who drop out of or never access health services, is needed to inform effective implementation.</p>

<p>Strategies of testing for syphilis during pregnancy. <strong>The Cochrane database of systematic reviews</strong> <em>Shahrook S Mori R Ochirbat T Gomi H</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25352226">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Each year about two million pregnant women are infected with preventable syphilis infection, mostly in developing countries. Despite the expansion of antenatal syphilis screening programmes over the past few decades, syphilis continues to be a major public health concern in developing countries. Point-of-care syphilis testing may be a useful strategy to substantially prevent syphilis-associated perinatal mortality and other negative consequences in resource-poor settings. However, the evidence on effectiveness has been generated mostly from observational study designs or has been reported as a mixed-intervention effect. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of antenatal syphilis screening in improving the uptake of screening tests and treatment, and reducing perinatal mortality. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2014) and the reference lists of retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised (individual and cluster) controlled trials comparing different screening tests conducted during routine antenatal check-ups versus no screening test. Cross-over trials and quasi-randomised experimental study designs were not eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked for accuracy. MAIN RESULTS: We included two cluster-randomised controlled trials (three reports). Both trials assessed point-of-care syphilis testing with conventional testing methods and together involved a total of 8493 pregnant women. Data from these trials were not amenable to meta-analysis as the measure of effectiveness was assessed in a non-comparable way.One trial randomised 14 antenatal clinics (including 7700 pregnant women) and was carried out at in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. The trial assessed one-stop syphilis testing using a rapid treponemal test, and was judged to have unclear methods of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, selective reporting, and other bias and low risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. Blinding was not reported and was assessed as high risk. The point-of-care testing provided screening, test results and treatment within the same day. The trial appears to have adjusted their results to account for clustering. We entered the data into RevMan using the generic inverse variance method. The incidence of congenital syphilis was lower in the clusters receiving on-site screening (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.71) and the proportion of women tested for syphilis was higher in the clusters receiving on-site screening at both the first antenatal visit and at the third trimester visit (OR 989.80, 95% CI 16.27 to 60233.05; OR 617.88, 95% CI 13.44 to 28399.01). Adequate treatment and partner treatment was higher with the on-site screening (AOR 10.44, 95% CI 1.00 to 108.99; AOR 18.17, 95% CI 3.23 to 101.20) and more syphilis cases were detected at first and third trimester visits with the on-site screening (AOR 2.45, 95% CI 1.44 to 4.18; AOR 6.27, 95% CI 1.47 to 26.69). Perinatal mortality, incidence of HIV/AIDS, obstacles in uptake of screening, any other adverse effects, or healthcare resource usage were not reported in this trial.The second trial divided clinics into seven matched pairs (including 7618 pregnant women, although results were only presented for the positive cases (793 women)), and within each pair one clinic was randomised to receive the on-site screening and the other to continue routine laboratory testing. The trial was conducted in primary healthcare clinics in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Random sequence generation were judged to be at low risk of bias, but allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data were judged to be high risk. Other bias and selective reporting bias remain unclear. Blinding was not reported and was assessed as high risk of bias. This trial assessed the primary outcome of this review (perinatal mortality) and the secondary outcomes (adverse outcomes; adequate treatment; syphilis prevalence) in the subset of women (793 women) who tested positive for syphilis. Only one outcome, adequate treatment, was adjusted to account for cluster design. However, not enough information was provided to include this in an analysis using the generic inverse variance method. Where possible, results have therefore been presented in forest plots (perinatal mortality; adequate treatment), as if the data are from a parallel randomised controlled trial. These results should therefore be interpreted with caution.The trial reported on perinatal mortality in women with positive test results and showed that on-site screening using a rapid plasma reagin test had no clear evidence of an effect on perinatal mortality reduction (odds ratio (OR) 0.63; 95% CI 0.27 to 1.48; 18/549 (3.3%) versus 8/157 (5.1%)). After loss to follow up, 396/618 (64.1%) women with positive test results received adequate treatment (two or more doses of 2.4 mega units of benzathine penicillin) in the intervention cluster versus 120/175 (68.6%) in the control (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.17). It was not possible to include any other data on reported outcomes in forest plots (adverse outcomes; syphilis prevalence). Incidence of congenital syphilis, proportion of women test for syphilis, incidence of HIV/AIDS, obstacles in uptake of screening, partner treatment, or healthcare resource usage were not reported in this trial. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review included evidence from two cluster-randomised trials at high or unclear risk of bias for most of the 'Risk of bias' domains. Data were not combined in meta-analysis because the trials used non-comparable measures of effectiveness.Point-of-care syphilis testing showed some promising results for syphilis detection and treatment rates and for use in different settings. In Mongolia point-of-care testing was found to be effective in increasing the proportion of pregnant women tested for syphilis and treatment provided, reducing congenital syphilis, and improving access to treatment for both women and their partners. In contrast, in rural South Africa, among women with positive test results, there was no clear evidence of an effect of point-of-care syphilis testing in increasing adequate syphilis treatment rates, and reducing perinatal mortality, but point-of-care testing was found to reduce delay in seeking treatment.More trials are therefore warranted to determine the effectiveness of available testing strategies for improving syphilis-associated adverse outcomes in pregnant women and neonates, especially in high-risk regions.</p>

<p>Minority HIV-1 drug-resistant mutations and prevention of mother-to-child transmission: perspectives for resource-limited countries. <strong>AIDS reviews</strong> <em>Samuel R Paredes R Parboosing R Moodley P Gordon M</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25300623">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>The detection and clinical significance of HIV-1 minority drug-resistant variants is a major topic of current HIV research. Whereas much attention has been placed on the clinical impact of minority drug-resistant variants in patients initiating antiretroviral therapy, their possible influence on the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy following prevention of mother-to-child transmission strategies in resource-limited settings remains largely unexplored. This review outlines the clinical significance and detection of minority drug-resistant variants, focusing primarily on studies of minority variants in the context of prevention of mother-to-child transmission and their possible influence on current regimens, especially those available in resource-limited countries. The clinical impact of minority nevirapine-resistant variants that arise in the context of prevention of mother-to-child transmission, for example, is an important factor to consider when these women initiate antiretroviral therapy that may include nevirapine or efavirenz. Minority nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant variants have been associated with treatment failure in women exposed to single-dose nevirapine. In countries like South Africa, with its longstanding use of single-dose nevirapine, this question is relevant as it is for other resource-limited countries where single-dose nevirapine is used. In the same context, various other minority drug-resistant variants (e.g. Y181C, K65R and thymidine analogue mutations etc.) are discussed. The field of next generation sequencing is very dynamic, with rapid improvements on present technologies and the introduction of novel technologies as discussed in this review. As the impact of minority drug-resistant variants in the setting of prevention of mother-to-child transmission becomes more evident, guidelines for this, especially in resource-limited countries, will need revision in order to optimize the clinical benefit from future antiretroviral therapy.</p>

<p>Observational research on NCDs in HIV-positive populations: conceptual and methodological considerations. <strong>Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999)</strong> <em>Petersen M Yiannoutsos CT Justice A Egger M</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25117964">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) account for a growing burden of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy interact with NCD risk factors in complex ways, and research into this &quot;web of causation&quot; has so far been largely based on data from high-income countries. However, improving the understanding, treatment, and prevention of NCDs in LMICs requires region-specific evidence. Priority research areas include: (1) defining the burden of NCDs among people living with HIV, (2) understanding the impact of modifiable risk factors, (3) evaluating effective and efficient care strategies at individual and health systems levels, and (4) evaluating cost-effective prevention strategies. Meeting these needs will require observational data, both to inform the design of randomized trials and to replace trials that would be unethical or infeasible. Focusing on Sub-Saharan Africa, we discuss data resources currently available to inform this effort and consider key limitations and methodological challenges. Existing data resources often lack population-based samples; HIV-negative, HIV-positive, and antiretroviral therapy-naive comparison groups; and measurements of key NCD risk factors and outcomes. Other challenges include loss to follow-up, competing risk of death, incomplete outcome ascertainment and measurement of factors affecting clinical decision making, and the need to control for (time-dependent) confounding. We review these challenges and discuss strategies for overcoming them through augmented data collection and appropriate analysis. We conclude with recommendations to improve the quality of data and analyses available to inform the response to HIV and NCD comorbidity in LMICs.</p>

<p>Totally drug-resistant tuberculosis and adjunct therapies. <strong>Journal of internal medicine</strong> <em>Parida SK Axelsson-Robertson R Rao MV Singh N Master I Lutckii A Keshavjee S Andersson J Zumla A Maeurer M</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809736">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>The first cases of totally drug-resistant (TDR) tuberculosis (TB) were reported in Italy 10 years ago; more recently, cases have also been reported in Iran, India and South Africa. Although there is no consensus on terminology, it is most commonly described as 'resistance to all first- and second-line drugs used to treat TB'. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) acquires drug resistance mutations in a sequential fashion under suboptimal drug pressure due to monotherapy, inadequate dosing, treatment interruptions and drug interactions. The treatment of TDR-TB includes antibiotics with disputed or minimal effectiveness against M.tb, and the fatality rate is high. Comorbidities such as diabetes and infection with human immunodeficiency virus further impact on TB treatment options and survival rates. Several new drug candidates with novel modes of action are under late-stage clinical evaluation (e.g., delamanid, bedaquiline, SQ109 and sutezolid). 'Repurposed' antibiotics have also recently been included in the treatment of extensively drug resistant TB. However, because of mutations in M.tb, drugs will not provide a cure for TB in the long term. Adjunct TB therapies, including therapeutic vaccines, vitamin supplementation and/or repurposing of drugs targeting biologically and clinically relevant molecular pathways, may achieve better clinical outcomes in combination with standard chemotherapy. Here, we review broader perspectives of drug resistance in TB and potential adjunct treatment options.</p>

<p>Drug resistance in the HIV-1-infected paediatric population worldwide: a systematic review. <strong>The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy</strong> <em>Rojas Sanchez P Holguin A</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24788658">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Drug resistance monitoring of the paediatric HIV-1-infected population is required to optimize treatment success and preserve future treatment options. OBJECTIVES: To explore the current knowledge of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) in naive and pretreated HIV-1-infected paediatric populations across diverse settings and sampling time periods. METHODS: PubMed database screened until May 2013. We selected publications including data on transmitted (TDR) and acquired drug resistance mutation (DRM) rates and/or pol sequences for HIVDR testing in paediatric patients. We recorded the children's country, age, study period, number of children with pol sequences, presence or absence of antiretroviral treatment (ART) at sampling time, viral region sequenced, HIVDR rate to the three main drug classes (single, double or triple), the considered resistance mutation list and performed assay, specimen type, HIV-1 variants and subtyping methodology when available. RESULTS: Forty-one selected studies showed HIVDR data from 2538 paediatric HIV-1-infected patients (558 naive and 1980 pretreated) from 30 countries in Africa (11), Asia (6), America (10) and Europe (3). Both TDR and DRM prevalence were reported in 9 studies, only TDR in 6 and only DRM in 26. HIVDR prevalence varied across countries and periods. Most studies used in-house resistance assays using plasma or infected cells. HIV-1 non-B variants were prevalent in 18 paediatric cohorts of the 24 countries with reported subtypes. Only five countries (Uganda, Spain, the UK, Brazil and Thailand) presented resistance data in &gt;/=200 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic and periodic studies among infected children are crucial to design a more suitable first- or second-line therapy.</p>

<p>Global control of tuberculosis: from extensively drug-resistant to untreatable tuberculosis. <strong>The Lancet. Respiratory medicine</strong> <em>Dheda K Gumbo T Gandhi NR Murray M Theron G Udwadia Z Migliori GB Warren R</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24717628">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis is a burgeoning global health crisis mainly affecting economically active young adults, and has high mortality irrespective of HIV status. In some countries such as South Africa, drug-resistant tuberculosis represents less than 3% of all cases but consumes more than a third of the total national budget for tuberculosis, which is unsustainable and threatens to destabilise national tuberculosis programmes. However, concern about drug-resistant tuberculosis has been eclipsed by that of totally and extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis--ie, resistance to all or nearly all conventional first-line and second-line antituberculosis drugs. In this Review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, management, implications for health-care workers, and ethical and medicolegal aspects of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis and other resistant strains. Finally, we discuss the emerging problem of functionally untreatable tuberculosis, and the issues and challenges that it poses to public health and clinical practice. The emergence and growth of highly resistant strains of tuberculosis make the development of new drugs and rapid diagnostics for tuberculosis--and increased funding to strengthen global control efforts, research, and advocacy--even more pressing.</p>

<p>Antibacterial resistance in sub-Saharan Africa: an underestimated emergency. <strong>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</strong> <em>Kariuki S Dougan G</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24628272">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>Antibacterial resistance-associated infections are known to increase morbidity, mortality, and cost of treatment, and to potentially put others in the community at higher risk of infections. In high-income countries, where the burden of infectious diseases is relatively modest, resistance to first-line antibacterial agents is usually overcome by use of second- and third-line agents. However, in developing countries where the burden of infectious diseases is high, patients with antibacterial-resistant infections may be unable to obtain or afford effective second-line treatments. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the situation is aggravated by poor hygiene, unreliable water supplies, civil conflicts, and increasing numbers of immunocompromised people, such as those with HIV, which facilitate both the evolution of resistant pathogens and their rapid spread in the community. Because of limited capacity for disease detection and surveillance, the burden of illnesses due to treatable bacterial infections, their specific etiologies, and the awareness of antibacterial resistance are less well established in most of SSA, and therefore the ability to mitigate their consequences is significantly limited.</p>

<p>Impact of geographic and transportation-related barriers on HIV outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review. <strong>AIDS and behavior</strong> <em>Lankowski AJ Siedner MJ Bangsberg DR Tsai AC</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563115">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>Difficulty obtaining reliable transportation to clinic is frequently cited as a barrier to HIV care in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Numerous studies have sought to characterize the impact of geographic and transportation-related barriers on HIV outcomes in SSA, but to date there has been no systematic attempt to summarize these findings. In this systematic review, we summarized this body of literature. We searched for studies conducted in SSA examining the following outcomes in the HIV care continuum: (1) voluntary counseling and testing, (2) pre-antiretroviral therapy (ART) linkage to care, (3) loss to follow-up and mortality, and (4) ART adherence and/or viral suppression. We identified 34 studies containing 52 unique estimates of association between a geographic or transportation-related barrier and an HIV outcome. There was an inverse effect in 23 estimates (44 %), a null association in 26 (50 %), and a paradoxical beneficial impact in 3 (6 %). We conclude that geographic and transportation-related barriers are associated with poor outcomes across the continuum of HIV care.</p>

<p>Association between nutritional status and the immune response in HIV + patients under HAART: protocol for a systematic review. <strong>Systematic reviews</strong> <em>Sicotte M Langlois EV Aho J Ziegler D Zunzunegui MV</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513015">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Over 850 million people worldwide and 200 million adults in Sub-Saharan Africa suffer from malnutrition. Countries most affected by HIV are also stricken by elevated rates of food insecurity and malnutrition. HIV infection and insufficient nutritional intake are part of a vicious cycle that contributes to immunodeficiency and negative health outcomes. However, the effect of the overlap between HIV infection and undernutrition on the immune response following antiretroviral initiation remains unclear. A possible explanation could be the lack of consensus concerning the definition and assessment of nutritional status. Our objectives are to investigate the existence of an association between undernutrition and immune response at antiretroviral treatment initiation and the following year in low- and middle-income countries where malnutrition is most prevalent. METHODS/DESIGN: Our systematic review will identify studies originating from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) published from 1996 onwards, through searches in MEDLINE (PubMed interface), EMBASE (OVID interface), Cochrane Central (OVID interface) and grey literature. No language restrictions will be applied. We will seek out studies of any design investigating the association between the nutritional status (for example, undernourished versus well nourished) and the immune response, either in terms of CD4 count or immune failure, in seropositive patients initiating antiretroviral therapy or in their first year of treatment. Two reviewers will independently screen articles, extract data and assess scientific quality using standardized forms and published quality assessment tools tailored for each study design. Where feasible, pooled measures of association will be obtained through meta-analyses. Results will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement. This protocol has been registered in the PROSPERO database (registration number: CRD42014005961). CONCLUSION: Undernutrition and weight loss are prevalent amongst highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-treated patients in LMICs and contribute to excess early mortality. A possible intermediate pathway could be poor immune reconstitution secondary to deficient nutritional status. In the face of limited access to second line treatments, raising HIV resistance and cut backs to HIV programs, it is crucial to identify the factors associated with suboptimal response and therapeutic failure in order to better customize the care strategies employed in LMICs.</p>

<p>Treatment of Kaposi sarcoma in children with HIV-1 infection. <strong>The Cochrane database of systematic reviews</strong> <em>Anglemyer A Agrawal AK Rutherford GW</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464843">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Kaposi sarcoma (KS) remains the second most frequently diagnosed HIV-related malignancy (HRM) worldwide and most common HRM in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV is most prevalent and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), the precipitating agent for the development of KS, is endemic. The majority of KS patients would likely benefit from systemic chemotherapy in addition to the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, as paediatric staging and treatment criteria are not readily available, there are no uniform treatment criteria. OBJECTIVES: To describe the efficacy and effectiveness of current treatment options for HIV-associated KS in ART-treated paediatric populations. SEARCH METHODS: We used standard Cochrane methods to search electronic databases and conference proceedings with relevant search terms without limits to language. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies of HIV-infected infants and children &lt;18 years old treated with ART and diagnosed with KS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Abstracts of all studies identified by electronic or bibliographic scanning were examined independently by two authors. We initially identified 920 references and examined 15 in detail for study eligibility. Data were abstracted independently using a standardised abstraction form. MAIN RESULTS: After initially screening 920 titles, 15 full-text articles were closely examined by two authors. We identified four cohort studies that met our inclusion criteria for data extraction, coding, and potential meta-analysis.Using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane risk of bias assessments, all observational studies had cohorts that were representative of average (treated and untreated) HIV-infected children with Kaposi sarcoma. For all outcomes of interest, no study adjusted for any other potential confounders. Two of four observational studies either explicitly described complete follow up of the study participants and/or described the characteristics of the participants lost to follow up.The use of ART together with a chemotherapeutic regimen versus ART alone appears to increase the likelihood of KS remission in HIV-infected children diagnosed with KS, although data are sparse and not adequately adjusted for staging of disease and comorbidities. Additionally, though data are sparse, the use of ART together with a chemotherapeutic regimen versus chemotherapy alone in some analyses appears to increase the likelihood of KS remission and reduce the risk of death in HIV-infected children diagnosed with KS.In this analysis, we found that the quality of evidence was very low due to small sample sizes and a paucity of paediatric literature. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Data describing the efficacy of different treatment options for pediatric KS, to include chemotherapy and ART, are sparse. However, the use of ART together with a chemotherapy regimen may be superior to the use of ART alone or of chemotherapy alone.</p>

<p>The magnitude of loss to follow-up of HIV-exposed infants along the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission continuum of care: a systematic review and meta-analysis. <strong>AIDS (London, England)</strong> <em>Sibanda EL Weller IV Hakim JG Cowan FM</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24056068">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>INTRODUCTION: Although prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) programs are widely implemented, many children do not benefit from them because of loss to follow-up (LTFU). We conducted a systematic review to determine the magnitude of infant/baby LTFU along the PMTCT cascade. METHODS: Eligible publications reported infant LTFU outcomes from standard care PMTCT programs (not intervention studies) at any stage of the cascade. Literature searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, Web of Knowledge, CINAHL Plus, and Maternity and Infant Care. Extracted data included setting, methods of follow-up, PMTCT regimens, and proportion and timing of LTFU. For programs in sub-Saharan Africa, random-effects meta-analysis was done using Stata v10. Because of heterogeneity, predictive intervals (PrIs; approximate 95% confidence intervals of a future study based on extent of observed heterogeneity) were computed. RESULTS: A total of 826 papers were identified; 25 publications were eligible. Studies were published from 2001 to 2012 and were mostly from sub-Saharan Africa (three were from India, one from UK and one from Ireland). There was extensive heterogeneity in findings. Eight studies reported on LTFU of pregnant HIV-positive women between antenatal care (ANC) registration and delivery, which ranged from 10.9 to 68.1%, pooled proportion 49.08% [95% confidence interval (CI) 39.6-60.9%], and PrI 22.0-100%. Fourteen studies reported LTFU of infants within 3 months of delivery, range 4.8-75%, pooled proportion 33.9% (27.6-41.5), and PrI 15.4-74.2. Children were also lost after HIV testing; this was reported in five studies, pooled estimate 45.5% (35.9-57.6), PrI 18.7-100%. Programs that actively tracked defaulters had better retention outcomes. CONCLUSION: There is unacceptable infant LTFU from PMTCT programs. Countries should incorporate defaulter-tracking as standard to improve retention.</p>

<p>Non-physician clinician provided HIV treatment results in equivalent outcomes as physician-provided care: a meta-analysis. <strong>Journal of the International AIDS Society</strong> <em>Emdin CA Chong NJ Millson PE</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23827470">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>INTRODUCTION: A severe healthcare worker shortage in sub-Saharan Africa is inhibiting the expansion of HIV treatment. Task shifting, the transfer of antiretroviral therapy (ART) management and initiation from doctors to nurses and other non-physician clinicians, has been proposed to address this problem. However, many health officials remain wary about implementing task shifting policies due to concerns that non-physicians will provide care inferior to physicians. To determine if non-physician-provided HIV care does result in equivalent outcomes to physician-provided care, a meta-analysis was performed. METHODS: Online databases were searched using a predefined strategy. The results for four primary outcomes were combined using a random effects model with sub-groups of non-physician-managed ART and -initiated ART. TB diagnosis rates, adherence, weight gain and patient satisfaction were summarized qualitatively. RESULTS: Mortality (N=59,666) had similar outcomes for non-physicians and physicians, with a hazard ratio of 1.05 (CI: 0.88-1.26). The increase in CD4 levels at one year, as a difference in means of 2.3 (N=17,142, CI: -12.7-17.3), and viral failure at one year, as a risk ratio of 0.89 (N=10,344, CI: 0.65-1.23), were similar for physicians and non-physicians. Interestingly, loss to follow-up (LTFU) (N=53,435) was reduced for non-physicians with a hazard ratio of 0.72 (CI: 0.56-0.94). TB diagnosis rates, adherence and weight gain were similar for non-physicians and physicians. Patient satisfaction appeared higher for non-physicians in qualitative components of studies and was attributed to non-physicians spending more time with patients as well as providing more holistic care. CONCLUSIONS: Non-physician-provided HIV care results in equivalent outcomes to care provided by physicians and may result in decreased LTFU rates.</p>

<p>Cryptococcal meningitis: improving access to essential antifungal medicines in resource-poor countries. <strong>The Lancet. Infectious diseases</strong> <em>Loyse A Thangaraj H Easterbrook P Ford N Roy M Chiller T Govender N Harrison TS Bicanic T</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23735626">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>Cryptococcal meningitis is the leading cause of adult meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa, and contributes up to 20% of AIDS-related mortality in low-income and middle-income countries every year. Antifungal treatment for cryptococcal meningitis relies on three old, off-patent antifungal drugs: amphotericin B deoxycholate, flucytosine, and fluconazole. Widely accepted treatment guidelines recommend amphotericin B and flucytosine as first-line induction treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. However, flucytosine is unavailable in Africa and most of Asia, and safe amphotericin B administration requires patient hospitalisation and careful laboratory monitoring to identify and treat common side-effects. Therefore, fluconazole monotherapy is widely used in low-income and middle-income countries for induction therapy, but treatment is associated with significantly increased rates of mortality. We review the antifungal drugs used to treat cryptococcal meningitis with respect to clinical effectiveness and access issues specific to low-income and middle-income countries. Each drug poses unique access challenges: amphotericin B through cost, toxic effects, and insufficiently coordinated distribution; flucytosine through cost and scarcity of registration; and fluconazole through challenges in maintenance of local stocks--eg, sustainability of donations or insufficient generic supplies. We advocate ten steps that need to be taken to improve access to safe and effective antifungal therapy for cryptococcal meningitis.</p>

<p>Pediatric HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa: emerging issues and way forward. <strong>African health sciences</strong> <em>Ubesie AC</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23382743">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Sub-Saharan Africa has the largest burden of pediatric HIV in the world. Global target has been set for eradication of pediatric HIV by 2015 but there are still so many complex issues facing HIV infected and affected children in the sub-continent. OBJECTIVE: To review the current and emerging challenges facing pediatric HIV care in sub-Saharan Africa; and proffer solutions that could help in tackling these challenges. METHOD: A Medline literature search of recent publications was performed to identify articles on &quot;pediatric HIV&quot;, &quot;HIV and children&quot;, &quot;HIV and infants&quot;, &quot;HIV and adolescents&quot; in sub-Saharan Africa. RESULT: There are a number of challenges and emerging complex issues facing children infected and affected by HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. These include late presentation, limited access to pediatric HIV services, delayed diagnosis, infant feeding choices, malnutrition, limited and complex drug regimen, disclosure, treatment failure and reproductive health concerns. A holistic cost effective preventive, diagnostic and treatment strategies are required in order to eliminate pediatric HIV in SSA. CONCLUSION: HIV infected children and their families in sub-Saharan Africa face myriad of complex medical and psychosocial issues. A holistic health promotional approach is being advocated as the required step for eradication of pediatric HIV in Africa.</p>

<p>Research on implementation of interventions in tuberculosis control in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review. <strong>PLoS medicine</strong> <em>Cobelens F van Kampen S Ochodo E Atun R Lienhardt C</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23271959">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Several interventions for tuberculosis (TB) control have been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) over the past decade. These include isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) for HIV-infected individuals and household contacts of infectious TB patients, diagnostic algorithms for rule-in or rule-out of smear-negative pulmonary TB, and programmatic treatment for multidrug-resistant TB. There is no systematically collected data on the type of evidence that is publicly available to guide the scale-up of these interventions in low- and middle-income countries. We investigated the availability of published evidence on their effectiveness, delivery, and cost-effectiveness that policy makers need for scaling-up these interventions at country level. METHODS AND FINDINGS: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and several regional databases were searched for studies published from 1 January 1990 through 31 March 2012 that assessed health outcomes, delivery aspects, or cost-effectiveness for any of these interventions in low- or middle-income countries. Selected studies were evaluated for their objective(s), design, geographical and institutional setting, and generalizability. Studies reporting health outcomes were categorized as primarily addressing efficacy or effectiveness of the intervention. These criteria were used to draw landscapes of published research. We identified 59 studies on IPT in HIV infection, 14 on IPT in household contacts, 44 on rule-in diagnosis, 19 on rule-out diagnosis, and 72 on second-line treatment. Comparative effectiveness studies were relatively few (n = 9) and limited to South America and sub-Saharan Africa for IPT in HIV-infection, absent for IPT in household contacts, and rare for second-line treatment (n = 3). Evaluations of diagnostic and screening algorithms were more frequent (n = 19) but geographically clustered and mainly of non-comparative design. Fifty-four studies evaluated ways of delivering these interventions, and nine addressed their cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: There are substantial gaps in published evidence for scale-up for five WHO-recommended TB interventions settings at country level, which for many countries possibly precludes program-wide implementation of these interventions. There is a strong need for rigorous operational research studies to be carried out in programmatic settings to inform on best use of existing and new interventions in TB control.</p>

<p>Emerging HIV-1 drug resistance after roll-out of antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa. <strong>Current opinion in HIV and AIDS</strong> <em>Hamers RL Sigaloff KC Kityo C Mugyenyi P de Wit TF</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23143140">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review provides an update of recent data on the development of HIV-1 drug resistance during treatment and its transmission in sub-Saharan Africa after the scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART). RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence is accumulating of a rising prevalence of transmitted HIV drug resistance (TDR), predominantly associated with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), in east and southern Africa. Pretherapy resistance is associated with first-line therapy failure. Accumulation of resistance mutations during first-line failure can be prevented by early detection and timely switching to second-line ART. Important gaps in service delivery and programme performance, associated with resistance development, affect a considerable proportion of ART programmes, particularly with respect to inadequate supply systems and patient retention. The reduction in new HIV infections associated with earlier use of ART is predicted to outweigh the risk of increasing TDR. Future levels of TDR are estimated to be diminished by improving switching practices to second-line regimens. SUMMARY: TDR is on the rise after the recent scale-up of ART in Africa. To prevent the development and spread of drug resistance and sustain the effectiveness of ART programmes, there is a need to improve drug supply systems, patient retention and access to routine viral load monitoring. Enhanced resistance monitoring is warranted in Africa.</p>

<p>Loss to programme between HIV diagnosis and initiation of antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa: systematic review and meta-analysis. <strong>Tropical medicine &amp; international health : TM &amp; IH</strong> <em>Mugglin C Estill J Wandeler G Bender N Egger M Gsponer T Keiser O</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22994151">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>OBJECTIVES: To assess the proportion of patients lost to programme (died, lost to follow-up, transferred out) between HIV diagnosis and start of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa, and determine factors associated with loss to programme. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed and EMBASE databases for studies in adults. Outcomes were the percentage of patients dying before starting ART, the percentage lost to follow-up, the percentage with a CD4 cell count, the distribution of first CD4 counts and the percentage of eligible patients starting ART. Data were combined using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies from sub-Saharan Africa including 148,912 patients were analysed. Six studies covered the whole period from HIV diagnosis to ART start. Meta-analysis of these studies showed that of the 100 patients with a positive HIV test, 72 (95% CI 60-84) had a CD4 cell count measured, 40 (95% CI 26-55) were eligible for ART and 25 (95% CI 13-37) started ART. There was substantial heterogeneity between studies (P &lt; 0.0001). Median CD4 cell count at presentation ranged from 154 to 274 cells/mul. Patients eligible for ART were less likely to become lost to programme (25%vs. 54%, P &lt; 0.0001), but eligible patients were more likely to die (11%vs. 5%, P &lt; 0.0001) than ineligible patients. Loss to programme was higher in men, in patients with low CD4 cell counts and low socio-economic status and in recent time periods. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring and care in the pre-ART time period need improvement, with greater emphasis on patients not yet eligible for ART.</p>

<p>Linking women who test HIV-positive in pregnancy-related services to long-term HIV care and treatment services: a systematic review. <strong>Tropical medicine &amp; international health : TM &amp; IH</strong> <em>Ferguson L Grant AD Watson-Jones D Kahawita T Ong'ech JO Ross DA</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22394050">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>OBJECTIVES: To quantify attrition between women testing HIV-positive in pregnancy-related services and accessing long-term HIV care and treatment services in low- or middle-income countries and to explore the reasons underlying client drop-out by synthesising current literature on this topic. METHODS: A systematic search in Medline, EMBASE, Global Health and the International Bibliography of the Social Sciences of literature published 2000-2010. Only studies meeting pre-defined quality criteria were included. RESULTS: Of 2543 articles retrieved, 20 met the inclusion criteria. Sixteen (80%) drew on data from sub-Saharan Africa. The pathway between testing HIV-positive in pregnancy-related services and accessing long-term HIV-related services is complex, and attrition was usually high. There was a failure to initiate highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among 38-88% of known-eligible women. Providing 'family-focused care', and integrating CD4 testing and HAART provision into prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services appear promising for increasing women's uptake of HIV-related services. Individual-level factors that need to be addressed include financial constraints and fear of stigma. CONCLUSIONS: Too few women negotiate the many steps between testing HIV-positive in pregnancy-related services and accessing HIV-related services for themselves. Recent efforts to stem patient drop-out, such as the MTCT-Plus Initiative, hold promise. Addressing barriers and enabling factors both within health facilities and at the levels of the individual woman, her family and society will be essential to improve the uptake of services.</p>

<p>Primary drug resistance in South Africa: data from 10 years of surveys. <strong>AIDS research and human retroviruses</strong> <em>Manasa J Katzenstein D Cassol S Newell ML de Oliveira T</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22251009">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance (TDR) could reverse the gains of antiretroviral rollout. To ensure that current first-line therapies remain effective, TDR levels in recently infected treatment-naive patients need to be monitored. A literature review and data mining exercise was carried out to determine the temporal trends in TDR in South Africa. In addition, 72 sequences from seroconvertors identified from Africa Centre's 2010 HIV surveillance round were also examined for TDR. Publicly available data on TDR were retrieved from GenBank, curated in RegaDB, and analyzed using the Calibrated Population Resistance Program. There was no evidence of TDR from the 2010 rural KwaZulu Natal samples. Ten datasets with a total of 1618 sequences collected between 2000 and 2010 were pooled to provide a temporal analysis of TDR. The year with the highest TDR rate was 2002 [6.67%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.09-13.79%; n=6/90]. After 2002, TDR levels returned to &lt;5% (WHO low-level threshold) and showed no statistically significant increase in the interval between 2002 and 2010. The most common mutations were associated with NNRTI resistance, K103N, followed by Y181C and Y188C/L. Five sequences had multiple resistance mutations associated with NNRTI resistance. There is no evidence of TDR in rural KwaZulu-Natal. TDR levels in South Africa have remained low following a downward trend since 2003. Continuous vigilance in monitoring of TDR is needed as more patients are initiated and maintained onto antiretroviral therapy.</p>

<p>Early mortality in adults initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC): a systematic review and meta-analysis. <strong>PloS one</strong> <em>Gupta A Nadkarni G Yang WT Chandrasekhar A Gupte N Bisson GP Hosseinipour M Gummadi N</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22220193">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>BACKGROUND: We systematically reviewed observational studies of early mortality post-antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) in Asia, Africa, and Central and South America, as defined by the World Bank, to summarize what is known. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Studies published in English between January 1996 and December 2010 were searched in Medline and EMBASE. Three independent reviewers examined studies of mortality within one year post-ART. An article was included if the study was conducted in a LMIC, participants were initiating ART in a non-clinical trial setting and were &gt;/=15 years. Fifty studies were included; 38 (76%) from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), 5 (10%) from Asia, 2 (4%) from the Americas, and 5 (10%) were multi-regional. Median follow-up time and pre-ART CD4 cell count ranged from 3-55 months and 11-192 cells/mm(3), respectively. Loss-to-follow-up, reported in 40 (80%) studies, ranged from 0.3%-27%. Overall, SSA had the highest pooled 12-month mortality probability of 0.17 (95% CI 0.11-0.24) versus 0.11 (95% CI 0.10-0.13) for Asia, and 0.07 (95% CI 0.007-0.20) for the Americas. Of 14 (28%) studies reporting cause-specific mortality, tuberculosis (TB) (5%-44%), wasting (5%-53%), advanced HIV (20%-37%), and chronic diarrhea (10%-25%) were most common. Independent factors associated with early mortality in 30 (60%) studies included: low baseline CD4 cell count, male sex, advanced World Health Organization clinical stage, low body mass index, anemia, age greater than 40 years, and pre-ART quantitative HIV RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Significant heterogeneity in outcomes and in methods of reporting outcomes exist among published studies evaluating mortality in the first year after ART initiation in LMIC. Early mortality rates are highest in SSA, and opportunistic illnesses such as TB and wasting syndrome are the most common reported causes of death. Strategies addressing modifiable risk factors associated with early death are urgently needed.</p>

<p>Antiretroviral drug supply challenges in the era of scaling up ART in Malawi. <strong>Journal of the International AIDS Society</strong> <em>Schouten EJ Jahn A Ben-Smith A Makombe SD Harries AD Aboagye-Nyame F Chimbwandira F</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21967844">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>The number of people receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) has increased considerably in recent years and is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. A major challenge is to maintain uninterrupted supplies of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and prevent stock outs. This article discusses issues around the management of ARVs and prevention of stock outs in Malawi, a low-income country with a high HIV/AIDS burden, and a weak procurement and supply chain management system. This system for ARVs, paid for by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and bypassing the government Central Medical Stores, is in place, using the United Nations Children's Fund's (UNICEF's) procurement services. The system, managed by a handful of people who spend limited time on supply management, is characterized by a centrally coordinated quantification based on verified data from all national ART clinics, parallel procurement through UNICEF, and direct distribution to ART clinics. The model worked well in the first years of the ART programme with a single first-line ARV regimen, but with more regimens becoming available (e.g., alternative first-line, second-line and paediatric regimens), it has become more difficult to administer. Managing supplies through a parallel system has the advantage that weaknesses in the national system have limited influence on the ARV procurement and supply chain management system. However, as the current system operates without a central warehouse and national buffer stock capacity, it diminishes the ability to prevent ARV stock outs. The process of ordering ARVs, from the time that estimates are made to the arrival of supplies in health facilities, takes approximately one year. Addressing the challenges involved in maintaining ARVs through an efficient procurement and supply chain management system that prevents ARV stock outs through the establishment of a dedicated procurement team, a central warehouse and/or national buffer stock is a priority.</p>

<p>Treatment strategies for Kaposi sarcoma in sub-Saharan Africa: challenges and opportunities. <strong>Current opinion in oncology</strong> <em>Krown SE</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21681092">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize recent published literature on treatment of AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma, the most common HIV-associated malignancy and a leading cancer diagnosis in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and to highlight the challenges faced in treating Kaposi sarcoma in this resource-limited environment. RECENT FINDINGS: There are few prospective clinical trials for Kaposi sarcoma treatment in SSA, along with a relatively poor cancer treatment infrastructure, leading to late diagnosis and poor access to therapy. The only prospectively randomized trial of chemotherapy compared antiretroviral therapy (HAART) alone to HAART with combination chemotherapy with doxorubicin, bleomycin and vincristine (ABV), and documented a significantly higher rate of tumor regression for the combination along with improvement in quality of life and no adverse effects on HIV control. Other studies suggest that gemcitabine may be an active second-line chemotherapeutic agent after failure of HAART and ABV and suggest that AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma in children may respond well to HAART with chemotherapy. There are also (primarily retrospective) data suggesting a beneficial effect of HAART on Kaposi sarcoma, but some evidence for Kaposi sarcoma as a manifestation of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. SUMMARY: Opportunities and need exist for prospective research to establish evidence-based guidelines for the most effective treatments for Kaposi sarcoma in SSA.</p>

<p>Strengthening health systems through HIV monitoring and evaluation in Sub-Saharan Africa. <strong>Current opinion in HIV and AIDS</strong> <em>Ekouevi DK Karcher S Coffie PA</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21546830">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we describe the challenges faced by using clinical cohorts to perform Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) and the possible solutions for increasing and strengthening health systems in low-income and middle-income countries. RECENT FINDINGS: HIV scale-up has facilitated the transition from paper-based medical records to electronic medical records at hundreds of sites in most of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa and the implementation of national HIV databases. However, National M&amp;E systems in resource-limited settings tend to be chronically challenged by persistently incomplete reporting and inaccurate data, which undermines their usefulness. In low-income and middle-income countries, new information technologies such as Web-based systems and mobile phone networks are expanding rapidly. Their use will improve data quality and, therefore, reduce participant dropout and improve reporting rates. These systems have the potential to allow real time access to summary reports and to integrate data from other settings such as maternal and infant health clinics. SUMMARY: The efforts to address the AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa will require enhanced information systems. Stronger systems are needed to deliver primary healthcare for those with and without HIV, and it is also essential to build and take advantage of synergies across health information systems.</p>

<p>Antiretroviral drug resistance--implications for HIV/AIDS reduction in sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries. <strong>Nigerian journal of medicine : journal of the National Association of Resident Doctors of Nigeria</strong> <em>Obiako OR Murktar HM Ogoina D</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21526620">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The introduction of the highly active antiretroviral therapy in the mid-1990s has significantly reduced morbidities and prolonged the lifespan of people living with HIV. However, the emergence of resistance to the antiretroviral drugs is becoming a major cause of treatment failure. While the problem of drug resistance is being tackled in developed countries, not much seem to be done in this regard in developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. This review looked at the regional distribution of HIV groups and subtypes and how this has affected the pattern of antiretroviral resistance. METHODS: The review was sourced from papers presented at international conferences on HIV/AIDS and rational drug use, relevant journals and Medline search using the keywords--Antiretroviral drugs, drug resistance, HIV subtypes and resistance testing. RESULTS: The types, groups, subtypes, sub-subtypes and recombinant forms of HIV-1 have been identified according to their geographical distributions. The evolution of HIV viral mutations, process (es) involved in development of primary and secondary antiretroviral drug resistance, including the role of HIV genetic polymorphisms, and transmitted resistance have been discussed. CONCLUSION: The pitfalls in the current resistance testing based on HIV-1 subtype B have been highlighted. The design of resistance testing algorithm based on HIV-1 subtype non-B has been suggested for the developing world.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: To estimate the proportion of all-cause adult patient attrition from antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs in service delivery settings in sub-Saharan Africa through 36 months on treatment. METHODS: We identified cohorts within Ovid Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and four conference abstract archives. We summarized retention rates from studies describing observational cohorts from sub-Saharan Africa reporting on adult HIV 1- infected patients initiating first-line three-drug ART. We estimated all-cause attrition rates for 6, 12, 18, 24, or 36 months after ART initiation including patients who died or were lost to follow-up (as defined by the author), but excluding transferred patients. RESULTS: We analysed 33 sources describing 39 cohorts and 226 307 patients. Patients were more likely to be female (median 65%) and had a median age at initiation of 37 (range 34-40). Median starting CD4 count was 109 cells/mm(3). Loss to follow-up was the most common cause of attrition (59%), followed by death (41%). Median attrition at 12, 24 and 36 months was 22.6% (range 7%-45%), 25% (range 11%-32%) and 29.5% (range 13%-36.1%) respectively. After pooling data in a random-effects meta-analysis, retention declined from 86.1% at 6 months to 80.2% at 12 months, 76.8% at 24 months and 72.3% at 36 months. Adjusting for variable follow-up time in a sensitivity analysis, 24 month retention was 70.0% (range: 66.7%-73.3%), while 36 month retention was 64.6% (range: 57.5%-72.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings document the difficulties in retaining patients in care for lifelong treatment, and the progress being made in raising overall retention rates.</p>

<p>Cost-effectiveness of laboratory monitoring in sub-Saharan Africa: a review of the current literature. <strong>Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America</strong> <em>Walensky RP Ciaranello AL Park JE Freedberg KA</em></p>

<p>As the global community evaluates the unprecedented investment in the scale-up of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) therapy and considers future investments in HIV care, it is crucial to identify those HIV interventions that maximize the benefit realized from each dollar spent. The use of laboratory monitoring assays--CD4 cell count and HIV RNA level--in decisions about when to initiate and switch antiretroviral therapy may offer substantial clinical benefit, but their economic value remains controversial. Cost-effectiveness analysis can be used to evaluate the value for money of strategies for HIV care, including alternative approaches to laboratory monitoring. Five published cost-effectiveness analyses address the question of CD4 cell count and HIV RNA level monitoring for HIV-infected patients in Africa, with differing conclusions. We describe the use of cost-effectiveness analysis in resource-limited settings and review the cost-effectiveness literature with regard to monitoring the CD4 cell count and HIV RNA level in Africa, highlighting some of the most critical issues in this debate.</p>

<p>Challenges in implementing HIV load testing in South Africa. <strong>The Journal of infectious diseases</strong> <em>Stevens WS Marshall TM</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20225952">Pubmed</a></p>
<p>The South African antiretroviral treatment guidelines recommend the use of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) load testing for patient monitoring and, in particular, to assist in switching to second-line treatment regimens. There are significant challenges to implementing HIV load testing on the scale that is required in South Africa. To put this in context, approximately 560,000 HIV-infected individuals are receiving antiretroviral therapy, and program recommendations include viral load testing twice per year. Currently, a 3-tiered laboratory infrastructure exists with tertiary facilities and, to some extent, secondary laboratories able to implement quantitative HIV nucleic acid testing. Challenges include high sample volumes, transportation logistics from remote sites, costs, phlebotomy in children, a national skills shortage, and sample throughput of technology platforms. Several approaches are thus being explored simultaneously: (1) the feasibility of establishing higher throughput and more automated central laboratories; (2) improvement of current sample collection, transportation, and storage techniques; (3) alternative viral load technologies, including flow-based marker screening approaches to reduce testing volumes, and (4) point-of-care viral load testing strategies for clinics. The development of appropriate solutions for each laboratory tier in South Africa will require close collaboration between researchers in the field and partners in industry.</p>

<p>Virological follow-up of adult patients in antiretroviral treatment programmes in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review. <strong>The Lancet. Infectious diseases</strong> <em>Barth RE van der Loeff MF Schuurman R Hoepelman AI Wensing AM</em></p>

<p>Following large-scale roll-out of antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa, the non-clinical efficacy of antiretroviral therapy has received little attention. We aimed to systematically review virological efficacy and drug-resistance outcomes of programmes of antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa. 89 studies with heterogeneous design, definitions, and methods were identified. Overall, in on-treatment analysis, 10 351 (78%) of 13 288 patients showed virological suppression after 6 months of antiretroviral therapy, 7413 (76%) of 9794 after 12 months, and 3840 (67%) of 5690 after 24 months. Long-term virological data are scarce. Genotyping results were available for patients with virological failure (HIV-1 RNA greater than 1000 copies per mL). Most patients (839 of 849; 99%) were infected with a non-B HIV-1 subtype. However, drug-resistance patterns were largely similar to those in subtype B. Resistance profiles were associated with the antiretroviral drugs commonly used: the lamivudine-associated M184V mutation was most common, followed by K103N which is associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Thymidine-analogue mutations and the K65R mutation were less common. First-line antiretroviral therapy regimens used in sub-Saharan Africa are effective. Profiles of drug resistance suggest that a second-line treatment regimen based on protease inhibitors, with a backbone of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, is a reasonable option for patients with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa who experience first-line treatment failure.</p>
