Articles from the results of the pubmed search will be excluded, if it:
 
- focuses only on co-infected people but no data about HIV from the selected African countries
- does not discuss both gender; men and women,
- focuses on diseases other than HIV,
- focuses on the causes of HIV treatment failure and dropout,
- focuses on countries which are not listed in our inclusion criteria (the thirteen countries),
- focuses only on pediatric HIV,
- does not discuss either HIV treatment failure rates or HIV dropout rates.

Note: last time you mentioned that we should not focus on what is mainly included, rather we should ask if the paper includes what we want (i.e. data from the 13 countries about treatment failure, dropout and others). Yes this point is very important. But by looking at the abstracts we are only going to see the main results (as abstracts are a highlight of the article itself). Thus, it is unlikely the articles to include data (results) of our interest in the abstract where its main objective is different (eg pediatric HIV, mathematical modeling works). 

Question: with respect to the above point, we may see mathematical modeling papers who present data on HIV (of our interest) in the main text but will most likely include the main results of model projections in the abstract. Because of this, I usually think of excluding a mathematical modeling paper immediately by just over looking the abstract quickly. How to include/exclude articles of such kind in this situation?
