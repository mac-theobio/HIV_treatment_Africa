Working on an I3D project ...

Now we have some insane stuff here that belongs elsewhere, but I would need to decide where. Maybe develop in its own repo, and then try to move key stuff to makestuff?

There is some extra chaining stuff here (extra pkl rules). It emerged from some insane debugging and may or may not be necessary.
