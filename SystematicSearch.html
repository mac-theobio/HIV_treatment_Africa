      <td>High Prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Among People with HIV on Stable ART in Southwestern Uganda.</td>
      <td>The objectives of this study were to determine the epidemiology and correlates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among Ugandans on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). We conducted a cross-sectional study at an HIV clinic in southwestern Uganda. We enrolled adult patients on non-nucleoside-based ART regimens for a minimum of 2 years. We collected anthropometric and clinical measurements, smoking history, and blood for fasting lipid profile and blood sugar (FBS). Outcomes of interest were (1) presence of metabolic syndrome (at least two of the following: FBS >100 mg/dL, blood pressure of >/=130/85 mmHg, triglycerides >/=150 mg/dL, HDL <40 mg/DL, or waist circumference >/=94 cm in males or >/=80 cm in females); and (2) a Framingham score correlating to >5% 10-year CVD risk. Of the 250 participants enrolled, metabolic syndrome was detected in 145/250 (58%) of participants (62% in females and 50% in males). Forty-three participants (17%) had a Framingham risk correlating to a 5% or greater risk for CVD within 10 years (26% in males and 13% in females). In multivariate analyses, being female (AOR 3.13; 95% CI: 1.0-9.70; p = 0.04) and over 40 years of age (AOR 1.78; 95% CI: 1.00-3.17; p = 0.05) was independently associated with having metabolic syndrome. We found no independent risk factors for a Framingham risk score 10-year risk exceeding 5%, or associations between ART regimen and CVD risk profiles. We conclude that metabolic abnormalities are common among patients on first-line ART in rural Uganda, and appear to be more common in women than men.</td>

      <td>Sustainable HIV treatment in Africa through viral-load-informed differentiated care.</td>
      <td>There are inefficiencies in current approaches to monitoring patients on antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa. Patients typically attend clinics every 1 to 3 months for clinical assessment. The clinic costs are comparable with the costs of the drugs themselves and CD4 counts are measured every 6 months, but patients are rarely switched to second-line therapies. To ensure sustainability of treatment programmes, a transition to more cost-effective delivery of antiretroviral therapy is needed. In contrast to the CD4 count, measurement of the level of HIV RNA in plasma (the viral load) provides a direct measure of the current treatment effect. Viral-load-informed differentiated care is a means of tailoring care so that those with suppressed viral load visit the clinic less frequently and attention is focussed on those with unsuppressed viral load to promote adherence and timely switching to a second-line regimen. The most feasible approach to measuring viral load in many countries is to collect dried blood spot samples for testing in regional laboratories; however, there have been concerns over the sensitivity and specificity of this approach to define treatment failure and the delay in returning results to the clinic. We use modelling to synthesize evidence and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of viral-load-informed differentiated care, accounting for limitations of dried blood sample testing. We find that viral-load-informed differentiated care using dried blood sample testing is cost-effective and is a recommended strategy for patient monitoring, although further empirical evidence as the approach is rolled out would be of value. We also explore the potential benefits of point-of-care viral load tests that may become available in the future.</td>

      <td>Scale-up of HIV Viral Load Monitoring--Seven Sub-Saharan African Countries.</td>
      <td>To achieve global targets for universal treatment set forth by the Joint United Nations Programme on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (UNAIDS), viral load monitoring for HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) must become the standard of care in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) (1). CDC and other U.S. government agencies, as part of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, are supporting multiple countries in sub-Saharan Africa to change from the use of CD4 cell counts for monitoring of clinical response to ART to the use of viral load monitoring, which is the standard of care in developed countries. Viral load monitoring is the preferred method for immunologic monitoring because it enables earlier and more accurate detection of treatment failure before immunologic decline. This report highlights the initial successes and challenges of viral load monitoring in seven countries that have chosen to scale up viral load testing as a national monitoring strategy for patients on ART in response to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. Countries initiating viral load scale-up in 2014 observed increases in coverage after scale-up, and countries initiating in 2015 are anticipating similar trends. However, in six of the seven countries, viral load testing coverage in 2015 remained below target levels. Inefficient specimen transport, need for training, delays in procurement and distribution, and limited financial resources to support scale-up hindered progress. Country commitment and effective partnerships are essential to address the financial, operational, technical, and policy challenges of the rising demand for viral load monitoring.</td>

      <td>Efavirenz-Based Antiretroviral Therapy Among Nevirapine-Exposed HIV-Infected Children in South Africa: A Randomized Clinical Trial.</td>
      <td>IMPORTANCE: Advantages of using efavirenz as part of treatment for children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) include once-daily dosing, simplification of co-treatment for tuberculosis, preservation of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir for second-line treatment, and harmonization of adult and pediatric treatment regimens. However, there have been concerns about possible reduced viral efficacy of efavirenz in children exposed to nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether nevirapine-exposed children achieving initial viral suppression with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir-based therapy can transition to efavirenz-based therapy without risk of viral failure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, open-label noninferiority trial conducted at Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa, from June 2010 to December 2013, enrolling 300 HIV-infected children exposed to nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission who were aged 3 years or older and had plasma HIV RNA of less than 50 copies/mL during ritonavir-boosted lopinavir-based therapy; 298 were randomized and 292 (98%) were followed up to 48 weeks after randomization. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to switch to efavirenz-based therapy (n = 150) or continue ritonavir-boosted lopinavir-based therapy (n = 148). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk difference between groups in (1) viral rebound (ie, >/=1 HIV RNA measurement of >50 copies/mL) and (2) viral failure (ie, confirmed HIV RNA >1000 copies/mL) with a noninferiority bound of -0.10. Immunologic and clinical responses were secondary end points. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier probability of viral rebound by 48 weeks was 0.176 (n = 26) in the efavirenz group and 0.284 (n = 42) in the ritonavir-boosted lopinavir group. Probabilities of viral failure were 0.027 (n = 4) in the efavirenz group and 0.020 (n = 3) in the ritonavir-boosted lopinavir group. The risk difference for viral rebound was 0.107 (1-sided 95% CI, 0.028 to infinity) and for viral failure was -0.007 (1-sided 95% CI, -0.036 to infinity). We rejected the null hypothesis that efavirenz is inferior to ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (P < .001) for both end points. By 48 weeks, CD4 cell percentage was 2.88% (95% CI, 1.26%-4.49%) higher in the efavirenz group than in the ritonavir-boosted lopinavir group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among HIV-infected children exposed to nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission and with initial viral suppression with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir-based therapy, switching to efavirenz-based therapy compared with continuing ritonavir-boosted lopinavir-based therapy did not result in significantly higher rates of viral rebound or viral failure. This therapeutic approach may offer advantages in children such as these. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01146873.</td>

      <td>A seven-year randomized evaluation suggests education subsidies reduce adolescent girls' dropout, pregnancy, and marriage but not sexually transmitted infection (STI). The government's HIV curriculum, which stresses abstinence until marriage, does not reduce pregnancy or STI. Both programs combined reduce STI more, but cut dropout and pregnancy less, than education subsidies alone. These results are inconsistent with a model of schooling and sexual behavior in which both pregnancy and STI are determined by one factor (unprotected sex), but consistent with a two-factor model in which choices between committed and casual relationships also affect these outcomes.</td>

      <td>Use of a Comprehensive HIV Care Cascade for Evaluating HIV Program Performance: Findings From 4 Sub-Saharan African Countries.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The traditional HIV treatment cascade has been noted to have limitations. A proposed comprehensive HIV care cascade that uses cohort methodology offers additional information as it accounts for all patients. Using data from 4 countries, we compare patient outcomes using both approaches. METHODS: Data from 390,603 HIV-infected adults (>15 years) enrolled at 217 facilities in Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Tanzania from 2005 to 2011 were included. Outcomes of all patients at 3, 6, and 12 months after enrollment were categorized as optimal, suboptimal, or poor. Optimal outcomes included retention in care, antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, and documented transfer. Suboptimal outcomes included retention in care without ART initiation among eligible patients or those without eligibility data. Poor outcomes included loss to follow-up and death. RESULTS: The comprehensive HIV care cascade demonstrated that at 3, 6 and 12 months, 58%, 51%, and 49% of patients had optimal outcomes; 22%, 12%, and 7% had suboptimal outcomes, and 20%, 37% and 44% had poor outcomes. Of all patients enrolled in care, 56% were retained in care at 12 months after enrollment. In comparison, the traditional HIV treatment cascade found 89% of patients enrolled in HIV care were assessed for ART eligibility, of whom 48% were determined to be ART-eligible with 70% initiating ART, and 78% of those initiated on ART retained at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive HIV care cascade follows outcomes of all patients, including pre-ART patients, who enroll in HIV care over time and uses quality of care parameters for categorizing outcomes. The comprehensive HIV care cascade provides complementary information to that of the traditional HIV treatment cascade and is a valuable tool for monitoring HIV program performance.</td>

      <td>The Impact of Different CD4 Cell-Count Monitoring and Switching Strategies on Mortality in HIV-Infected African Adults on Antiretroviral Therapy: An Application of Dynamic Marginal Structural Models.</td>
      <td>In Africa, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is delivered with limited laboratory monitoring, often none. In 2003-2004, investigators in the Development of Antiretroviral Therapy in Africa (DART) Trial randomized persons initiating ART in Uganda and Zimbabwe to either laboratory and clinical monitoring (LCM) or clinically driven monitoring (CDM). CD4 cell counts were measured every 12 weeks in both groups but were only returned to treating clinicians for management in the LCM group. Follow-up continued through 2008. In observational analyses, dynamic marginal structural models on pooled randomized groups were used to estimate survival under different monitoring-frequency and clinical/immunological switching strategies. Assumptions included no direct effect of randomized group on mortality or confounders and no unmeasured confounders which influenced treatment switch and mortality or treatment switch and time-dependent covariates. After 48 weeks of first-line ART, 2,946 individuals contributed 11,351 person-years of follow-up, 625 switches, and 179 deaths. The estimated survival probability after a further 240 weeks for post-48-week switch at the first CD4 cell count less than 100 cells/mm(3) or non-Candida World Health Organization stage 4 event (with CD4 count <250) was 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94, 0.97) with 12-weekly CD4 testing, 0.96 (95% CI: 0.95, 0.97) with 24-weekly CD4 testing, 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.96) with a single CD4 test at 48 weeks (baseline), and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.94) with no CD4 testing. Comparing randomized groups by 48-week CD4 count, the mortality risk associated with CDM versus LCM was greater in persons with CD4 counts of <100 (hazard ratio = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3, 4.3) than in those with CD4 counts of >/=100 (hazard ratio = 1.1, 95% CI: 0.8, 1.7; interaction P = 0.04). These findings support a benefit from identifying patients immunologically failing first-line ART at 48 weeks.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for loss to follow-up (LTFU) in an HIV-infected pediatric population in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, between 2004 and 2011. DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis of 6236 HIV-infected children. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 6236 pediatric patients enrolled in care and treatment in Dar es Salaam from October 2004 to September 2011. LTFU was defined as missing a clinic visit for >90 days for patients on ART and for >180 days for patients in care and monitoring. The relationship of baseline and time-varying characteristics to the risk of LTFU was examined using a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: A total of 2130 children (34%) were LTFU over a median follow-up of 16.7 months (interquartile range, 3.4-36.9). Factors independently associated with a higher risk of LTFU were age </=2 years (relative risk [RR] = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.40 to 1.80), diarrhea at enrollment (RR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.41), a low mid-upper arm circumference for age (RR = 1.20, CI: 1.05 to 1.37), eating protein-rich foods </=3 times a week (RR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.90), taking cotrimoxazole (RR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.81), initiating onto antiretrovirals (RR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.61), receiving treatment at a hospital instead of a local facility (RR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.41), and starting treatment in 2006 or later (RR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.16). CONCLUSIONS: Health workers should be aware of pediatric patients who are at a greatest risk of LTFU, such as younger and undernourished patients, so that they can proactively counsel families about the importance of visit adherence. Findings support decentralization of HIV care to local facilities as opposed to hospitals.</td>

      <td>Outcomes of TB/HIV co-infected patients presenting with antituberculosis drug-induced liver injury.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: South Africa has a significant burden of tuberculosis (TB). Anti-TB drug-induced liver injury (TB DILI) is one of the most serious adverse events that can arise from TB treatment (TBT). There are limited data on TB DILI among HIV-infected patients and those on antiretroviral therapy (ART). OBJECTIVE: To describe characteristics of HIV-infected patients presenting with TB DILI and the proportion reintroduced on standard or modified TBT after DILI. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of TB/HIV co-infected patients with DILI between 1 July 2009 and 30 September 2012. The primary focus of interest was HIV-infected patients with TB DILI on ART (ART/TB DILI) v. not on ART (TB DILI). RESULTS: A total of 94 patients were included, 41 with TB DILI and 53 with ART/TB DILI. Compared with patients with TB DILI, patients with ART/TB DILI were more likely to present with symptomatic DILI (71.2% v. 51.2%; p=0.03) and had a lower median alanine aminotransferase level at diagnosis (89 IU/L v. 118 IU/L; p=0.008), a lower rate of ALT decline (-23 IU/L v. -76 IU/L; p=0.047) and longer duration of TBT at DILI diagnosis (53 days v. 11 days; p&lt;0.001). In 71.8% of patients, standard TBT was reintroduced. More patients with ART/TB DILI than TB DILI required modified TBT (37.2% v.17.1%; p=0.05; crude odds ratio 2.17; 95% confidence interval 0.95 - 4.96). The rate of death/loss to follow-up was higher in the ART/TB DILI group (18.9% v. 14.5%). CONCLUSION: A significant number of TB/HIV co-infected patients were not able to tolerate standard TBT. Furthermore, ART appears to complicate TBT, with relatively few patients reintroduced on standard TBT.</td>

      <td>Implementation and Operational Research: Integration of PMTCT and Antenatal Services Improves Combination Antiretroviral Therapy Uptake for HIV-Positive Pregnant Women in Southern Zambia: A Prototype for Option B+?</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Early initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for HIV-positive pregnant women can decrease vertical transmission to less than 5%. Programmatic barriers to early cART include decentralized care, disease-stage assessment delays, and loss to follow-up. INTERVENTION: Our intervention had 3 components: integrated HIV and antenatal services in 1 location with 1 provider, laboratory courier to expedite CD4 counts, and community-based follow-up of women-infant pairs to improve prevention of mother-to-child transmission attendance. Preintervention HIV-positive pregnant women were referred to HIV clinics for disease-stage assessment and cART initiation for advanced disease (CD4 count <350 cells/muL or WHO stage >2). METHODS: We used a quasi-experimental design with preintervention/postintervention evaluations at 6 government antenatal clinics (ANCs) in Southern Province, Zambia. Retrospective clinical data were collected from clinic registers during a 7-month baseline period. Postintervention data were collected from all antiretroviral therapy-naive, HIV-positive pregnant women and their infants presenting to ANC from December 2011 to June 2013. RESULTS: Data from 510 baseline women-infant pairs were analyzed and 624 pregnant women were enrolled during the intervention period. The proportion of HIV-positive pregnant women receiving CD4 counts increased from 50.6% to 77.2% [relative risk (RR) = 1.81; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.57 to 2.08; P < 0.01]. The proportion of cART-eligible pregnant women initiated on cART increased from 27.5% to 71.5% (RR = 2.25; 95% CI: 1.78 to 2.83; P < 0.01). The proportion of eligible HIV-exposed infants with documented 6-week HIV PCR test increased from 41.9% to 55.8% (RR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.18 to 1.51; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Integration of HIV care into ANC and community-based support improved uptake of CD4 counts, proportion of cART-eligible women initiated on cART, and infants tested.</td>

      <td>Test characteristics and potential impact of the urine LAM lateral flow assay in HIV-infected outpatients under investigation for TB and able to self-expectorate sputum for diagnostic testing.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The commercially available urine LAM strip test, a point-of-care tuberculosis (TB) assay, requires evaluation in a primary care setting where it is most needed. There is currently inadequate data to guide implementation in TB and HIV-endemic settings. METHODS: Adult HIV-infected outpatients with suspected pulmonary TB able to self-expectorate sputum from four primary clinics in South Africa, Zambia and Tanzania underwent diagnostic evaluation [sputum smear microscopy, Xpert-MTB/RIF, and culture (reference standard)] as part of a prospective parent study. Urine LAM testing (grade-2 cut-point) was performed on archived samples. Performance characteristics of LAM alone or in combination with sputum-based diagnostics were evaluated. Potential impact on 2 and 6-month morbidity (TBscore), patient dropout rates, and prognosis (death/ loss to follow-up) were evaluated. RESULTS: Among 583 participants with suspected TB that were HIV-infected or refused testing, the overall LAM sensitivity (95 % CI; n/N) and in the CD4 </= 100 cells/mm(3) sub-group was 22.7 % (16.6-28.7; 41/181) and 30.4 % (17.1-43.7; 14/46), respectively. Overall specificity was 93.0 % (90.5-95.6; 361/388). Amongst culture-positive TB cases, adjunctive LAM testing did not improve the sensitivity of either sputum Xpert-MTB/RIF [78.2 % (69.8-86.7; 72/92) versus 76.1 % (67.4-84.8; 70/92), p = 0.7] or smear-microscopy [56.2 % (45.9-66.5; 50/89) versus 43.8 % (33.5-54.1; 39/89), p = 0.1). Clinic-based LAM, as an adjunct to either smear microscopy or Xpert MTB/RIF same-day testing, would neither have decreased patient dropout, nor increased same-day treatment initiation in this clinical setting where same-day chest radiography was available. LAM positivity was associated with 6-month lost-to-follow-up/death (AOR 4.4; p = 0.002) but not TBscore (at baseline or change in TBscore 2-months post-treatment) (p = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS: In African HIV-TB co-infected outpatients able to self-expectorate sputum LAM had limited sensitivity even at low CD4 counts, and offered no significant incremental diagnostic yield over Xpert-MTB/RIF or smear microscopy. In primary care clinics with chest radiography and where empiric TB treatment is common, LAM seems unlikely to improve rates of same-day treatment initiation and patient dropout, however, the ability of LAM to identify patients at high risk of death or lost-to-follow-up may offer important prognostic value.</td>

      <td>Determinants of loss to follow-up in patients on antiretroviral treatment, South Africa, 2004-2012: a cohort study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The number of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected people eligible for initiation on antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is increasing. ART programmatic success requires that patients who are taking ART remain on treatment and are followed up regularly. This study investigated factors associated with being lost to follow-up, in a cohort of patients enrolled in a pharmacovigilance study in South Africa. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational cohort study performed at one of the Medunsa National Pharmacovigilance Centre's (MNPC) ART sentinel surveillance sites. Loss to Follow-up (LTFU) was defined as "a patient who had been followed up at the sentinel site, who had not had contact with the health facility for 180 days or more since their last recorded expected date of return or if there were 180 days or more between the expected date of return and the next clinic visit". RESULTS: Out of 595 patients, 65.5% (n = 390) were female and 23.4% (n = 139) were LTFU. The median time on ART before LTFU was 21.5 months (interquartile range: 12.9 - 34.7 months). The incidence rate of LTFU was 103 per 1000 person-years in the first year on ART and increased to 405 per 1000 person-years in the eighth year of taking ART. Factors associated with becoming LTFU included not having a committed partner (Adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR): 2.9, 95% Confidence Interval (CI):1.19-6.97, p = 0.019), being self-employed (aHR: 13.9, 95% CI:2.81 - 69.06, p = 0.001), baseline CD4 count > 200 cells/ml (aHR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.85-7.85, p < 0.001), detectable last known Viral Load (VL) (aHR: 3.6, 95% CI:1.98-6.52, p < 0.001) and a last known World Health Organisation clinical stage three or four (aHR: 2.0, 95% CI:1.22-3.27, p = 0.006). Patients that previously had an ART adverse event had a lower risk (aHR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.38 - 0.99, p = 0.044) of becoming LTFU than those that had not. CONCLUSION: The incidence rate of LTFU increases with additional years on ART. Intensified measures to improve patient retention on ART must be prioritised with increasing patient time on ART and in patients that are at increased risk of becoming lost to follow-up.</td>

      <td>Pooled Nucleic Acid Testing to Detect Antiretroviral Treatment Failure in HIV-Infected Patients in Mozambique.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In resource-limited settings, viral load monitoring of HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not readily available because of high costs. Here, we compared the accuracy and costs of quantitative and qualitative pooled methods with standard viral load testing. METHODS: Blood was collected prospectively from 461 patients receiving first-line ART in Mozambique who had not been evaluated previously with viral load testing. Screening for virologic failure of ART was performed quantitatively (ie, standard viral loads) and qualitatively [one and 2 rounds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)]. Individual samples and minipools of 5 samples were then analyzed using both methods. The relative efficiency, accuracy, and costs of each method were calculated based on viral load thresholds for ART failure. RESULTS: Standard viral load testing of individual samples revealed a high rate of ART failure (19%-23%) across all virologic failure thresholds, and the majority of the patients (93%) with viral loads >1500 copies per milliliter had genotypic resistance to drugs in their ART regimen. Pooled quantitative screening and deconvolution testing had positive and negative predictive values exceeding 95% with cost savings of $11,250 compared with quantitative testing of each sample individually. Pooled qualitative screening and deconvolution testing had a higher cost savings of $30,147 for 1 PCR round and $25,535 for 2 PCR rounds compared with quantitative testing each sample individually. Both pooled qualitative PCR methods had positive and negative predictive values >/=90%, but the pooled 1-round PCR method had a sensitivity of 64%. CONCLUSIONS: Given the high rate of undiagnosed ART failure and drug resistance in this cohort, it is clear that virologic monitoring is urgently needed in this population. Here, we compared alternative methods of virologic monitoring with standard viral load testing of individual samples and found these methods to be cost saving and accurate. The test characteristics of each method will likely need to be considered for each local population before it is adopted.</td>

      <td>Duration of Antiretroviral Therapy Adherence Interruption Is Associated With Risk of Virologic Rebound as Determined by Real-Time Adherence Monitoring in Rural Uganda.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence interruptions have been associated with viral rebound; however, the true risk is unknown because HIV RNA has never been measured during ongoing interruptions. METHODS: The Uganda AIDS Rural Treatment Outcomes Study is an observational longitudinal cohort of adults initiating ART. We monitored adherence with the device that wirelessly transmits records of device openings, and routinely assessed HIV RNA quarterly. When lapses of 48+ hours between device openings were detected, we made unannounced visits to participants to investigate the cause and assess HIV RNA. Generalized estimating equation logistic regressions were used to assess factors associated with viral rebound. RESULTS: We followed 479 participants (median: 25 months per participant). Most were women (72%), median age was 36 years, median pre-ART CD4 count was 198 cells per microliter, median pre-ART HIV RNA level was 5.0 log10 copies per milliliter, and median duration of prior viral suppression was 13 months. A total of 587 adherence interruptions followed confirmed prior viral suppression, of which 13 (2%) had detectable viral rebound. Viral rebound was associated with duration of adherence interruption (odds ratio: 1.25 for each day beyond 48 hours; P = 0.007) and 30-day adherence before the interruption (odds ratio: 0.73; P = 0.02). DISCUSSION: This article is the first demonstration of HIV RNA rebound during adherence interruptions objectively measured in real time. Odds of viral rebound increased by 25% with each day beyond 48 hours. Real-time adherence monitoring was feasible in a sub-Saharan African setting. Further research should assess the potential for real-time adherence interventions to sustain adherence to affordable first-line regimens.</td>

      <td>The availability of essential medicines for mental healthcare in Sofala, Mozambique.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: We assessed the availability of essential medicines for mental healthcare (MH) across levels of the public healthcare system to aid in future systems planning. DESIGN: Non-expired MH medications were assessed in 24 public health facilities and 13 district warehouses across Sofala Province, Mozambique, from July to August 2014. Medication categories included: antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antiepileptics and mood stabilizers, and anticholinergics and antihistamines. RESULTS: Only 7 of 12 (58.3%) district warehouses, 11 of 24 (45.8%) of all health facilities, and 10 of 12 (83.3%) of facilities with trained MH staff had availability of at least one medication of each category. Thioridazine was the most commonly available antipsychotic across all facilities (9 of 24, 37.5%), while chlorpromazine and thioridazine were most common at facilities providing MH care (8 of 12, 66.7%). The atypical antipsychotic risperidone was not available at any facility or district warehouse. Amitriptyline was the most commonly available antidepressant (10 of 12 districts; 12 of 24 overall facilities; 9 or 12 MH facilities). Despite being on the national essential drug list, fluoxetine was only available at one quaternary-level facility and no district warehouses. CONCLUSIONS: Essential psychotropic medicines are routinely unavailable at public health facilities. Current essential drug lists include six typical but no atypical antipsychotics, which is concerning given the side-effect profiles of typical antipsychotics. Ensuring consistent availability of at least one selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor should also be a priority, as they are essential for the treatment of individuals with underlying cardiovascular disease and/or suicidal ideation. Similar to successful task-sharing approaches used for HIV/AIDS, mid-level providers could be retrained and certified to prescribe and monitor first-line psychotropic regimens.</td>

      <td>Effect of Community Support Agents on Retention of People Living With HIV in Pre-antiretroviral Care: A Randomized Controlled Trial in Eastern Uganda.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Over 50% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in sub-Saharan Africa are lost to follow-up between diagnosis and initiation of antiretroviral treatment during pre-antiretroviral (pre-ARV) care. The effect of providing home counseling visits by community support agents on 2-year retention in pre-ARV care was evaluated through a randomized controlled trial in eastern Uganda. METHODS: Four hundred newly screened HIV-positive patients were randomly assigned to receive posttest counseling alone (routine arm) or posttest counseling and monthly home counseling visits by community support agents to encourage them go back for routine pre-ARV care (intervention arm). The outcome measure was the proportion of new PLHIV in either arm who attended their scheduled pre-ARV care visits for at least 6 of the anticipated 8 visits in the first 24 months after HIV diagnosis. The difference between the 2 study arms was assessed using the chi and T tests. Mantel-Haenszel Risk Ratios and multivariate logistic models were used to assess the adjusted effect of the intervention on the outcome. RESULTS: In all models generated, participants receiving monthly home counseling visits were 2.5 times more likely to be retained in pre-ARV compared with those in standard care over a period of 24 months (adjusted risk ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval: 2.0 to 3.0). CONCLUSION: Monthly follow-up home visits by community workers more than doubled the retention of PLHIV in pre-ARV care in rural Uganda and can be applicable in similar resource-poor settings.</td>

      <td>Implementation and Operational Research: Expedited Results Delivery Systems Using GPRS Technology Significantly Reduce Early Infant Diagnosis Test Turnaround Times.</td>
      <td>The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of a new technology to communicate the results of an infant HIV diagnostic test on test turnaround time and to quantify the association between late delivery of test results and patient loss to follow-up. We used data collected during a pilot implementation of Global Package Radio Service (GPRS) printers for communicating results in the early infant diagnosis program in Mozambique from 2008 through 2010. Our dataset comprised 1757 patient records, of which 767 were from before implementation and 990 from after implementation of expedited results delivery system. We used multivariate logistic regression model to determine the association between late result delivery (more than 30 days between sample collection and result delivery to the health facility) and the probability of result collection by the infant's caregiver. We used a sample selection model to determine the association between late result delivery to the facility and further delay in collection of results by the caregiver. The mean test turnaround time reduced from 68.13 to 41.05 days post-expedited results delivery system. Caregivers collected only 665 (37.8%) of the 1757 results. After controlling for confounders, the late delivery of results was associated with a reduction of approximately 18% (0.44 vs. 0.36; P < 0.01) in the probability of results collected by the caregivers (odds ratio = 0.67, P < 0.05). Late delivery of results was also associated with a further average increase in 20.91 days of delay in collection of results (P < 0.01). Early infant diagnosis program managers should further evaluate the cost-effectiveness of operational interventions (eg, GPRS printers) that reduce delays.</td>

      <td>Implementation and Operational Research: Correlates of Adherence and Treatment Failure Among Kenyan Patients on Long-term Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Universal access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is still elusive in most developing nations. We asked whether peer support influenced adherence and treatment outcome and if a single viral load (VL) could define treatment failure in a resource-limited setting. METHODS: A multicenter longitudinal and cross-sectional survey of VL, CD4 T cells, and adherence in 546 patients receiving HAART for up to 228 months. VL and CD4 counts were determined using m2000 Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay and FACS counters, respectively. Adherence was assessed based on pill count and on self-report. RESULTS: Of the patients, 55.8%, 22.2%, and 22% had good, fair, and poor adherence, respectively. Adherence, peer support, and regimen, but not HIV disclosure, age, or gender, independently correlated with VL and durability of treatment in a multivariate analysis (P < 0.001). Treatment failure was 35.9% using sequential VL but ranged between 27% and 35% using alternate single VL cross-sectional definitions. More patients failed stavudine (41.2%) than zidovudine (37.4%) or tenofovir (28.8%, P = 0.043) treatment arms. Peer support correlated positively with adherence (chi(2), P < 0.001), with nonadherence being highest in the stavudine arm. VL before the time of regimen switch was comparable between patients switching and not switching treatment. Moreover, 36% of those switching still failed the second-line regimen. CONCLUSION: Weak adherence support and inaccessible VL testing threaten to compromise the success of HAART scale-up in Kenya. To hasten antiretroviral therapy monitoring and decision making, we suggest strengthening patient-focused adherence programs, optimizing and aligning regimen to WHO standards, and a single point-of-care VL testing when multiple tests are unavailable.</td>

      <td>Programmatic treatment outcomes in HIV-infected and uninfected drug-resistant TB patients in Khayelitsha, South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: South Africa has high burdens of HIV, TB and drug-resistant TB (DR-TB, rifampicin-resistance). Treatment outcome data for HIV-infected versus uninfected patients is limited. We assessed the impact of HIV and other factors on DR-TB treatment success, time to culture conversion, loss-from-treatment and overall mortality after second-line treatment initiation. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted for patients initiated on DR-TB treatment from 2008 to 2012, within a community-based, decentralised programme in Khayelitsha, South Africa. RESULTS: Among 853 confirmed DR-TB patients initiating second-line treatment, 605 (70.9%) were HIV infected. HIV status did not impact on time to sputum culture conversion nor did it impact treatment success; 48.1% (259/539) and 45.9% (100/218), respectively (p=0.59). In a multivariate model, HIV was not associated with treatment success. Death during treatment was higher among HIV-infected patients, but overall mortality was not significantly higher. HIV-infected patients with CD4 <=100 cells/ml were significantly more likely to die after starting treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Response to DR-TB treatment did not differ with HIV infection in a programmatic setting with access to antiretroviral treatment (ART). Earlier ART initiation at a primary care level could reduce mortality among HIV-infected patients presenting with low CD4 counts.</td>

      <td>Cost per patient of treatment for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis in a community-based programme in Khayelitsha, South Africa.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: The high cost of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) treatment hinders treatment access. South Africa has a high RR-TB burden, and national policy outlines decentralisation to improve access and reduce costs. We analysed health system costs associated with RR-TB treatment by drug resistance profile and treatment outcome in a decentralised programme. METHODS: Retrospective, routinely collected patient-level data were combined with unit cost data to determine costs for each patient in a cohort treated between January 2009 and December 2011. Drug costs were based on recommended regimens according to drug resistance and treatment duration. Hospitalisation costs were estimated based on admission/discharge dates, while clinic visit and diagnostic/monitoring costs were estimated according to recommendations and treatment duration. Missing data were imputed. RESULTS: Among 467 patients (72% HIV infected), 49% were successfully treated. Treatment was initiated in primary care for 62%, with the remainder as inpatients. The mean cost per patient treated was $7916 (range 260-87,140), ranging from $5369 among patients who did not complete treatment to $23,006 for treatment failure. Mean cost for successful treatment was $8359 (2585-32,506). Second-line drug resistance was associated with a mean cost of $15,567 vs. $6852 for only first-line resistance, with the major cost difference due to hospitalisation. Costs are reported in 2013 USD. CONCLUSIONS: RR-TB treatment cost was high and varied according to treatment outcome. Despite decentralisation, hospitalisation remained a significant cost, particularly among those with more extensive resistance and those with treatment failure. These cost estimates can be used to model the impact of new interventions to improve patient outcomes.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVES: To assess the care of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and/or HIV patients enrolled into Medication Adherence Clubs (MACs). METHODS: Retrospective descriptive study was carried out using routinely collected programme data from a primary healthcare clinic at informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya. All patients enrolled into MACs were selected for the study. MACs are nurse-facilitated mixed groups of 25-35 stable hypertension, diabetes mellitus and/or HIV patients who met quarterly to confirm their clinical stability, have brief health discussions and receive medication. Clinical officer reviewed MACs yearly, when a patient developed complications or no longer met stable criteria. RESULTS: A total of 1432 patients were enrolled into 47 clubs with 109 sessions conducted between August 2013 and August 2014. There were 1020 (71%) HIV and 412 (29%) non-communicable disease patients. Among those with NCD, 352 (85%) had hypertension and 60 (15%) had DM, while 12 had HIV concurrent with hypertension. A total of 2208 consultations were offloaded from regular clinic. During MAC attendance, blood pressure, weight and laboratory testing were completed correctly in 98-99% of consultations. Only 43 (2%) consultations required referral for clinical officer review before their routine yearly appointment. Loss to follow-up from the MACs was 3.5%. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility and early efficacy of MACs for mixed chronic disease in a resource-limited setting. It supports burden reduction and flexibility of regular clinical review for stable patients. Further assessment regarding long-term outcomes of this model should be completed to increase confidence for deployment in similar contexts.</td>

      <td>Incidence and predictors of attrition from antiretroviral care among adults in a rural HIV clinic in Coastal Kenya: a retrospective cohort study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Scale up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to substantial declines in HIV related morbidity and mortality. However, attrition from ART care remains a major public health concern and has been identified as one of the key reportable indicators in assessing the success of ART programs. This study describes the incidence and predictors of attrition among adults initiating ART in a rural HIV clinic in Coastal Kenya. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study design was used. Adults (>/= 15 years) initiated ART between January 2008 and December 2010 were followed up for two years. Attrition was defined as individuals who were either reported dead or lost to follow up (LFU, >/= 180 days late since the last clinic visit). Kaplan Meier survival probabilities and Weibull baseline hazard regression analyses were used to model the incidence and predictors of time to attrition. RESULTS: Of the 928 eligible participants, 308 (33.2% [95% CI, 30.2 - 36.3]) underwent attrition at an incident rate of 23.1 (95% CI, 20.6 - 25.8)/100 pyo. Attrition at 6 and 12 months was 18.4% (95% CI, 16.0 - 21.1) and 23.2% (95% CI, 19.9 - 25.3) respectively. Gender (male vs. female, adjusted hazard ratio [95% CI], p-value: 1.5 [1.1 - 2.0], p = 0.014), age (15 - 24 vs. >/= 45 years, 2.2 [1.3 - 3.7], p = 0.034) and baseline CD4 T-cell count (100 - 350 cells/uL vs. < 100 cells/uL, 0.5 [0.3 - 0.7], p = 0.002) were independent predictors of time to attrition. CONCLUSIONS: A third of individuals initiating ART were either reported dead or LFU during two years of care, with more than a half of these occurring within six months of treatment initiation. Practical and sustainable biomedical interventions and psychosocial support systems are warranted to improve ART retention in this setting.</td>

      <td>Very early virological failure and drug resistance mutations in a woman on antiretroviral therapy in Eastern Cape, South Africa: a case report.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy rollout in Sub-Saharan African countries faces the challenge of virological failure. This could be the consequence of transmitted drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus strains at the population level. While a pre-antiretroviral therapy genotypic test has been a major component of the human immunodeficiency virus management programme in developed nations, it is yet to be incorporated into the antiretroviral therapy programme in resource-poor countries. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old Black African woman was seen for her six-month routine review. Her viral load after initiation of fixed drug combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine and efavirenz was 31,397 RNA copies/mL. Adherence was assessed to be good based on pharmacy pick-up dates, on-time clinic appointment records, medical file review, self-reporting and treatment supporter's report. Her viral load was repeated after another two months of close monitoring; the result showed viral load of 31,159 RNA copies/mL. She was assessed as virological failure to her first-line antiretrovirals and commenced on second-line antiretrovirals: zidovudine/lamivudine/Aluvia((R)) (lopinavir and ritonavir). A human immunodeficiency virus drug genotypic testing showed she was only susceptible to zidovudine and protease inhibitors. At third month on the new regimen, her viral load was suppressed. CONCLUSIONS: This case report demonstrates the possibility of a silent epidemic within the human immunodeficiency virus pandemic in resource-poor settings like Eastern Cape, South Africa. We described a case of early virological failure in a highly motivated young woman. Although, a pre-antiretroviral therapy genotypic test is yet to be incorporated into a human immunodeficiency virus programme in resource-poor countries, the need for it might become evident as the programme expands. Close monitoring of the viral load of patients according to national guidelines will enable early detection of a failing regimen and prompt intervention can be instituted to prevent morbidity and mortality. There is an urgent need to strengthen the human immunodeficiency virus programme in resource-poor countries to prevent the emergence of an epidemic of transmitted drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus strains within the existing human immunodeficiency virus pandemic.</td>

      <td>Implementation and Operational Research: Evaluation of Loss-to-Follow-up and Postoperative Adverse Events in a Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision Program in Nyanza Province, Kenya.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: More than 4.7 million voluntary medical male circumcisions (VMMCs) had been provided by HIV prevention programs in sub-Saharan Africa through 2013. All VMMC clients are recommended to return to the clinic for postoperative follow-up, although adherence is variable. The clinical status of clients who do not return is largely unknown. METHODS: VMMC clients from Nyanza Province, Kenya, aged older than or equal to 13 years, were recruited immediately after surgery from April to October 2012 from high-volume sites. Medical record reviews at 13-14 days after surgery indicated which clients had been adherent with recommended follow-up (ADFU) and which were lost-to-follow-up (LTFU). Clients in the LTFU group received clinical evaluations at home approximately 2 weeks postsurgery. Adverse events (AEs) and AE rates were compared between the ADFU and LTFU groups. RESULTS: Of 4504 males approached in 50 VMMC sites, 1699 (37.7%) were eligible and enrolled and 1600 of 1699 (94.2%) contributed to follow-up and AE data. Medical record review indicated 897 of 1600 (56.1%) were LTFU, and 762 (84.9%) of these received home-based clinical evaluations. The rate of moderate or severe AE diagnosis was 6.8% in the LTFU group vs. 3.3% in the ADFU group (relative risk = 2.1, 95% confidence interval: 1.3 to 3.4). CONCLUSIONS: The moderate or severe AE diagnosis rate was approximately 2 times higher in the LTFU group. National programs should consider instituting surveillance systems to detect AEs that might otherwise go unnoticed. Providers should emphasize the importance of follow-up and actively contact LTFU clients to ensure care is provided throughout the entire postoperative course for all.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: We previously published systematic reviews of retention in care after antiretroviral therapy initiation among general adult populations in sub-Saharan Africa. We estimated 36-month retention at 73% for publications from 2007 to 2010. This report extends the review to cover 2008-2013 and expands it to all low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Register, and ISI Web of Science from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2013, and abstracts from AIDS and IAS from 2008-2013. We estimated retention across cohorts using simple averages and interpolated missing times through the last time reported. We estimated all-cause attrition (death, loss to follow-up) for patients receiving first-line antiretroviral therapy in routine settings in low- and middle-income countries. RESULTS: We found 123 articles and abstracts reporting retention for 154 patient cohorts and 1,554,773 patients in 42 countries. Overall, 43% of all patients not retained were known to have died. Unweighted averages of reported retention were 78%, 71%, and 69% at 12, 24, and 36 months, after treatment initiation, respectively. We estimated 36-month retention at 65% in Africa, 80% in Asia, and 64% in Latin America and the Caribbean. From lifetable analysis, we estimated retention at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months at 83%, 74%, 68%, 64%, and 60%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Retention at 36 months on treatment averages 65%-70%. There are several important gaps in the evidence base, which could be filled by further research, especially in terms of geographic coverage and duration of follow-up.</td>

      <td>Factors Associated with Timing of Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy among HIV-1 Infected Adults in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Based on growing evidence mainly from countries outside Sub-Saharan Africa, the World Health Organisation (WHO) now recommends initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected individuals in developing countries when CD4 cell count (CD4+) is </= 500 cells/ul. Nigeria accounts for about 14% of the estimated HIV/AIDS burden in Sub-Saharan Africa. We evaluated the factors associated with timing of initiation of ART among treatment-ineligible HIV-infected adults from Nigeria. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the hospital records of ART ineligible HIV-infected adults who enrolled into HIV care between January 2008 and December 2012 at two major tertiary hospitals in Bayelsa State, South-South Nigeria. Demographic, clinical and laboratories data were obtained at presentation, at each subsequent visit at 6 monthly intervals and at time of initiation of ART. Cox proportional regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to evaluate independent predictors of time to initiation of ART. RESULTS: Amongst the 280 study participants, 70.6% were females, 62.6% had CD4+ >/=500 cells/ul, 48.4% had WHO HIV Stage 1 disease and 34.3% were lost to follow up. In a cohort of 180 participants followed up for >/=3 months, participants with CD4+ of 351-500 cells/ul and stage 2 disease were more likely to start ART earlier than those with CD4+ > 500 cells/ul (Hazard ratio [HR]-1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] of 1.0-2.9) and stage 1 disease (HR-2.3 (95% CI-1.3-4.2) respectively. HIV-infected adults with faster CD4+ decay required earlier ART initiation, especially in the first year of follow up. CONCLUSION: ART-ineligible HIV-infected adults on follow up in South-South Nigeria are more likely to require earlier initiation of ART if they have stage 2 HIV disease or CD4+ </=500 cells/ul at presentation. Our findings suggest faster progression of HIV-disease in these groups of individuals and corroborate the growing evidence in support for earlier initiation of ART.</td>

      <td>Rapid emergence of multidrug resistant, H58-lineage Salmonella typhi in Blantyre, Malawi.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Between 1998 and 2010, S. Typhi was an uncommon cause of bloodstream infection (BSI) in Blantyre, Malawi and it was usually susceptible to first-line antimicrobial therapy. In 2011 an increase in a multidrug resistant (MDR) strain was detected through routine bacteriological surveillance conducted at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH). METHODS: Longitudinal trends in culture-confirmed Typhoid admissions at QECH were described between 1998-2014. A retrospective review of patient cases notes was conducted, focusing on clinical presentation, prevalence of HIV and case-fatality. Isolates of S. Typhi were sequenced and the phylogeny of Typhoid in Blantyre was reconstructed and placed in a global context. RESULTS: Between 1998-2010, there were a mean of 14 microbiological diagnoses of Typhoid/year at QECH, of which 6.8% were MDR. This increased to 67 in 2011 and 782 in 2014 at which time 97% were MDR. The disease predominantly affected children and young adults (median age 11 [IQR 6-21] in 2014). The prevalence of HIV in adult patients was 16.7% [8/48], similar to that of the general population (17.8%). Overall, the case fatality rate was 2.5% (3/94). Complications included anaemia, myocarditis, pneumonia and intestinal perforation. 112 isolates were sequenced and the phylogeny demonstrated the introduction and clonal expansion of the H58 lineage of S. Typhi. CONCLUSIONS: Since 2011, there has been a rapid increase in the incidence of multidrug resistant, H58-lineage Typhoid in Blantyre. This is one of a number of reports of the re-emergence of Typhoid in Southern and Eastern Africa. There is an urgent need to understand the reservoirs and transmission of disease and how to arrest this regional increase.</td>

      <td>Ten-year surgical experiences with penile cancer at a tertiary care hospital in northwestern Tanzania: a retrospective study of 236 patients.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Penile cancer is an uncommon malignancy in developed countries, but the incidence is as high as 10% to 20% of all male cancers in some developing countries. There is a paucity of published data on this subject in our setting. This study describes the clinicopathological presentation and treatment outcome of this condition in our environment, and highlights challenges associated with the care of these patients and proffers solutions for improved outcome. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of histologically confirmed cases of penile cancer seen at Bugando Medical Centre between January 2004 and December 2013. RESULTS: There were 236 penile cancer patients representing 2.2% of all male malignancies during the study period. The median age was 47 years with a modal age group of 41 to 50 years. Of the 236 patients, 147 (62.3%) had severe phimosis. The majority of patients (89.8%) were uncircumcised. A history of human papilloma virus (HPV) was reported in 12 (5.1%) cases. One hundred eighty-two (77.1%) patients reported history of cigarette smoking. Seven (6.7%) patients were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive. The majority of the patients (68.6%) presented with Jackson's stages III and IV. Squamous cell carcinoma was the most common histopathological type (99.2%). Lymph node metastasis was recorded in 65.3% of cases, and it was significantly associated with the tumor size, histopathological subtype, histopathological grade, lympho-vascular invasion, positive resection margins, and urethral involvement (P < 0.001). Distant metastasis accounted for 4.2% of cases. The majority of patients (63.1%) underwent partial penectomy. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy were given in 14 (5.9%) and 12 (5.1%) patients, respectively. Complication and mortality rates were 22.0% and 4.2%, respectively. HIV positivity, histopathological stage and grade of the tumor, and presence of metastases at the time of diagnosis were the main predictors of death (P < 0.001). The median length of hospitalization was 14 days. Local recurrence was reported in 12 (5.3%) patients. Data on long-term survivals were not available as the majority of patients were lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Penile cancer is not rare in our environment. The majority of patients present late with advanced stage of the disease. Early detection of primary cancer at an early stage may improve the prognosis.</td>

      <td>Supporting close-to-community providers through a community health system approach: case examples from Ethiopia and Tanzania.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Close-to-community (CTC) providers, including community health workers or volunteers or health extension workers, can be effective in promoting access to and utilization of health services. Tasks are often shifted to these providers with limited resources and support from CTC programmes or communities. The Community Health System Strengthening (CHSS) model is part of an improvement approach which draws on existing formal and informal networks within a community, such as agricultural or women's groups, to support CTC providers and address gaps in community-based health services. The model offers a framework for bringing representatives from existing community networks, CTC providers, and health facility staff together to form a community team charged with identifying challenges in service delivery, testing solutions, and monitoring changes. CTC providers draw upon fellow community team members to disseminate health messages and refer community members in need of services. CASES: Two cases are presented. In Ethiopia, the CHSS model was applied in 18 communities to increase HIV testing among pregnant women and antenatal care service utilization and improve sanitation. Prior to implementation, representatives from community groups were unaware of health extension workers or were uncomfortable making referrals. By participating on the community team, representatives became familiar with and comfortable referring people to health extension workers and spreading health messages. During implementation, more pregnant women registered for antenatal care and tested for HIV; health extension workers conducted more postnatal visits; and more households had functioning latrines and proper latrine use increased. In Tanzania, the CHSS model was applied in five communities to improve HIV testing and retention into care. Community team members talked to their families and social networks about HIV testing and, when they identified someone who had dropped out of treatment, they referred those individuals to the home-based care volunteer. Increases in HIV testing and a reduction in patients lost to follow-up were observed. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The CHSS model brings together existing networks within communities to support and lend legitimacy to CTC providers. This approach may result in sustainable community-based programmes, especially in HIV where the continuum of care extends beyond the facility and into the community.</td>

      <td>Cost-effectiveness of first-line antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected African children less than 3 years of age.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The International Maternal, Pediatric, and Adolescent Clinical Trials P1060 trial demonstrated superior outcomes for HIV-infected children less than 3 years old initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) with lopinavir/ritonavir compared to nevirapine, but lopinavir/ritonavir is four-fold costlier. DESIGN/METHODS: We used the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC)-Pediatric model, with published and P1060 data, to project outcomes under three strategies: no ART; first-line nevirapine (with second-line lopinavir/ritonavir); and first-line lopinavir/ritonavir (second-line nevirapine). The base-case examined South African children initiating ART at age 12 months; sensitivity analyses varied all key model parameters. Outcomes included life expectancy, lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICERs; dollars/year of life saved ($/YLS)]. We considered interventions with ICERs less than 1x per-capita gross domestic product (South Africa: $7500)/YLS as 'very cost-effective,' interventions with ICERs below 3x gross domestic product/YLS as 'cost-effective,' and interventions leading to longer life expectancy and lower lifetime costs as 'cost-saving'. RESULTS: Projected life expectancy was 2.8 years with no ART. Both ART regimens markedly improved life expectancy and were very cost-effective, compared to no ART. First-line lopinavir/ritonavir led to longer life expectancy (28.8 years) and lower lifetime costs ($41 350/person, from lower second-line costs) than first-line nevirapine (27.6 years, $44 030). First-line lopinavir/ritonavir remained cost-saving or very cost-effective compared to first-line nevirapine unless: liquid lopinavir/ritonavir led to two-fold higher virologic failure rates or 15-fold greater costs than in the base-case, or second-line ART following first-line lopinavir/ritonavir was very ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of P1060 data, first-line lopinavir/ritonavir leads to longer life expectancy and is cost-saving or very cost-effective compared to first-line nevirapine. This supports WHO guidelines, but increasing access to pediatric ART is critical regardless of the regimen used.</td>

      <td>Tuberculosis prevention in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: South Africa has one of the highest per capita rates of tuberculosis (TB) incidence in the world. In 2012, the South African government produced a National Strategic Plan (NSP) to control the spread of TB with the ambitious aim of zero new TB infections and deaths by 2032, and a halving of the 2012 rates by 2016. METHODS: We used a transmission model to investigate whether the NSP targets could be reached if immediate scale up of control methods had happened in 2014. We explored the potential impact of four intervention portfolios; 1) "NSP" represents the NSP strategy, 2) "WHO" investigates increasing antiretroviral therapy eligibility, 3) "Novel Strategies" considers new isoniazid preventive therapy strategies and HIV "Universal Test and Treat" and 4) "Optimised" contains the most effective interventions. FINDINGS: We find that even with this scale-up, the NSP targets are unlikely to be achieved. The portfolio that achieved the greatest impact was "Optimised", followed closely by "NSP". The "WHO" and "Novel Strategies" had little impact on TB incidence by 2050. Of the individual interventions explored, the most effective were active case finding and reductions in pre-treatment loss to follow up which would have a large impact on TB burden. CONCLUSION: Use of existing control strategies has the potential to have a large impact on TB disease burden in South Africa. However, our results suggest that the South African TB targets are unlikely to be reached without new technologies. Despite this, TB incidence could be dramatically reduced by finding and starting more TB cases on treatment.</td>

      <td>Is zidovudine first-line therapy virologically comparable to tenofovir in resource-limited settings?</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To compare virologic success between adult patients on tenofovir (TDF) and zidovudine (AZT)-containing first-line antiretroviral (ART) regimens in 10 rural clinics in Lesotho, Southern Africa. METHODS: Multicentre cross-sectional study, patients >/=16 years, on first-line ART >/=6 months, receiving AZT/lamivudine (3TC) or TDF/3TC combined with efavirenz (EFV) or nevirapine (NVP). Patient characteristics and clinical/therapeutic history were collected on the day of blood draw for viral load (VL). Analysis was stratified for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (EFV or NVP). A logistic regression model weighted for patients' baseline characteristics was used to assess the likelihood of virologic success (<80 copies/ml) in patients with TDF- as compared to AZT-backbones. RESULTS: In total 1539 patients were included in the analysis. Most were clinically and immunologically stable (clinical failure: 2.7% (AZT) and 2.8% (TDF); immunological failure: 4.6% (AZT) and 4.8% (TDF)). In EFV-based regimens (n = 1162), TDF was significantly associated with higher rates of virologic suppression than AZT (93.8% vs. 88.1%; weighted odds ratio: 2.15 (95% CI: 1.29-3.58; P = 0.003)). In NVP-based regimens, a similar trend was observed, but not significant (89.4% vs. 86.7%; 1.99 (0.83-4.75, P = 0.121)). CONCLUSION: These findings support the WHO recommendation to use TDF/3TC/EFV as first-line regimen. They do, however, not support the recommendation that patients who are clinically stable on AZT should continue on this first-line regimen.</td>

      <td>Reassessment of HIV-1 acute phase infectivity: accounting for heterogeneity and study design with simulated cohorts.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The infectivity of the HIV-1 acute phase has been directly measured only once, from a retrospectively identified cohort of serodiscordant heterosexual couples in Rakai, Uganda. Analyses of this cohort underlie the widespread view that the acute phase is highly infectious, even more so than would be predicted from its elevated viral load, and that transmission occurring shortly after infection may therefore compromise interventions that rely on diagnosis and treatment, such as antiretroviral treatment as prevention (TasP). Here, we re-estimate the duration and relative infectivity of the acute phase, while accounting for several possible sources of bias in published estimates, including the retrospective cohort exclusion criteria and unmeasured heterogeneity in risk. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimated acute phase infectivity using two approaches. First, we combined viral load trajectories and viral load-infectivity relationships to estimate infectivity trajectories over the course of infection, under the assumption that elevated acute phase infectivity is caused by elevated viral load alone. Second, we estimated the relative hazard of transmission during the acute phase versus the chronic phase (RHacute) and the acute phase duration (dacute) by fitting a couples transmission model to the Rakai retrospective cohort using approximate Bayesian computation. Our model fit the data well and accounted for characteristics overlooked by previous analyses, including individual heterogeneity in infectiousness and susceptibility and the retrospective cohort's exclusion of couples that were recorded as serodiscordant only once before being censored by loss to follow-up, couple dissolution, or study termination. Finally, we replicated two highly cited analyses of the Rakai data on simulated data to identify biases underlying the discrepancies between previous estimates and our own. From the Rakai data, we estimated RHacute = 5.3 (95% credibility interval [95% CrI]: 0.79-57) and dacute = 1.7 mo (95% CrI: 0.55-6.8). The wide credibility intervals reflect an inability to distinguish a long, mildly infectious acute phase from a short, highly infectious acute phase, given the 10-mo Rakai observation intervals. The total additional risk, measured as excess hazard-months attributable to the acute phase (EHMacute) can be estimated more precisely: EHMacute = (RHacute - 1) x dacute, and should be interpreted with respect to the 120 hazard-months generated by a constant untreated chronic phase infectivity over 10 y of infection. From the Rakai data, we estimated that EHMacute = 8.4 (95% CrI: -0.27 to 64). This estimate is considerably lower than previously published estimates, and consistent with our independent estimate from viral load trajectories, 5.6 (95% confidence interval: 3.3-9.1). We found that previous overestimates likely stemmed from failure to account for risk heterogeneity and bias resulting from the retrospective cohort study design. Our results reflect the interaction between the retrospective cohort exclusion criteria and high (47%) rates of censorship amongst incident serodiscordant couples in the Rakai study due to loss to follow-up, couple dissolution, or study termination. We estimated excess physiological infectivity during the acute phase from couples data, but not the proportion of transmission attributable to the acute phase, which would require data on the broader population's sexual network structure. CONCLUSIONS: Previous EHMacute estimates relying on the Rakai retrospective cohort data range from 31 to 141. Our results indicate that these are substantial overestimates of HIV-1 acute phase infectivity, biased by unmodeled heterogeneity in transmission rates between couples and by inconsistent censoring. Elevated acute phase infectivity is therefore less likely to undermine TasP interventions than previously thought. Heterogeneity in infectiousness and susceptibility may still play an important role in intervention success and deserves attention in future analyses.</td>

      <td>Immunological failure of first-line and switch to second-line antiretroviral therapy among HIV-infected persons in Tanzania: analysis of routinely collected national data.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: Rates of first-line treatment failure and switches to second-line therapy are key indicators for national HIV programmes. We assessed immunological treatment failure defined by WHO criteria in the Tanzanian national HIV programme. METHODS: We included adults initiating first-line therapy in 2004-2011 with a pre-treatment CD4 count, and >/=6-months of follow-up. We assessed subhazard ratios (SHR) for immunological treatment failure, and subsequent switch to second-line therapy, using competing risks methods to account for deaths. RESULTS: Of 121 308 adults, 7% experienced immunological treatment failure, and 2% died without observed immunological treatment failure, over a median 1.7 years. The 6-year cumulative probability of immunological treatment failure was 19.0% (95% CI 18.5, 19.7) and of death, 5.1% (4.8, 5.4). Immunological treatment failure predictors included earlier year of treatment initiation (P < 0.001), initiation in lower level facilities (SHR = 2.23 [2.03, 2.45] for dispensaries vs. hospitals), being male (1.27 [1.19, 1.33]) and initiation at low or high CD4 counts (for example, 1.78 [1.65, 1.92] and 5.33 [4.65, 6.10] for <50 and >/=500 vs. 200-349 cells/mm(3) , respectively). Of 7382 participants in the time-to-switch analysis, 6% switched and 5% died before switching. Four years after immunological treatment failure, the cumulative probability of switching was 7.3% (6.6, 8.0) and of death, 6.8% (6.0, 7.6). Those who immunologically failed in dispensaries, health centres and government facilities were least likely to switch. CONCLUSIONS: Immunological treatment failure rates and unmet need for second-line therapy are high in Tanzania; virological monitoring, at least for persons with immunological treatment failure, is required to minimise unnecessary switches to second-line therapy. Lower level government health facilities need more support to reduce treatment failure rates and improve second-line therapy uptake to sustain the benefits of increased coverage.</td>

      <td>Pharmacodynamic Modeling of Bacillary Elimination Rates and Detection of Bacterial Lipid Bodies in Sputum to Predict and Understand Outcomes in Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-tolerant bacterial persistence prevents treatment shortening in drug-susceptible tuberculosis, and accumulation of intracellular lipid bodies has been proposed to identify a persister phenotype of Mycobacterium tuberculosis cells. In Malawi, we modeled bacillary elimination rates (BERs) from sputum cultures and calculated the percentage of lipid body-positive acid-fast bacilli (%LB + AFB) on sputum smears. We assessed whether these putative measurements of persistence predict unfavorable outcomes (treatment failure/relapse). METHODS: Adults with pulmonary tuberculosis received standard 6-month therapy. Sputum samples were collected during the first 8 weeks for serial sputum colony counting (SSCC) on agar and time-to positivity (TTP) measurement in mycobacterial growth indicator tubes. BERs were extracted from nonlinear and linear mixed-effects models, respectively, fitted to these datasets. The %LB + AFB counts were assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Patients were followed until 1 year posttreatment. Individual BERs and %LB + AFB counts were related to final outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-three patients (56% HIV coinfected) participated, and 15 unfavorable outcomes were reported. These were inversely associated with faster sterilization phase bacillary elimination from the SSCC model (odds ratio [OR], 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], .22-.70) and a faster BER from the TTP model (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, .55-.94). Higher %LB + AFB counts on day 21-28 were recorded in patients who suffered unfavorable final outcomes compared with those who achieved stable cure (P = .008). CONCLUSIONS: Modeling BERs predicts final outcome, and high %LB + AFB counts 3-4 weeks into therapy may identify a persister bacterial phenotype. These methods deserve further evaluation as surrogate endpoints for clinical trials.</td>

      <td>Steven-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) are severe adverse drug reactions, characterized by extensive epidermal detachment and erosions of mucous membrane. SJS/TEN is one of the most serious adverse reactions to Nevirapine (NVP) treatment, commonly used in developing countries as first-line treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection. In the last years TRAF3IP2 gene variants had been described as associated with susceptibility to several diseases such as psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We hypothesized that this gene, involved in immune response and in NF-kappaB activation, could also be implicated in the SJS/TEN susceptibility. We performed a full resequencing of TRAF3IP2 gene in a population of patients treated with NVP. Twenty-seven patients with NVP-induced SJS/TEN and 78 controls, all from Mozambique, were enrolled. We identified eight exonic and three intronic already described variants. The case/control association analysis highlighted an association between the rs76228616 SNP in exon 2 and the SJS/TEN susceptibility. In particular, the variant allele (C) resulted significantly associated with a higher risk to develop SJS/TEN (p = 0.012 and OR = 3.65 (95% CI 1.33-10.01)). A multivariate analysis by logistic regression confirmed its significant contribution (p = 0.027, OR = 4.39 (95% CI 1.19-16.23)). In conclusion, our study suggests that a variant in TRAF3IP2 gene could be involved in susceptibility to SJS/TEN.</td>

From February, 2012, we enrolled eligible individuals with HIV infection (age >/=18 years, CD4 count of <200 cells per muL, ART naive) and randomly assigned them to either the standard clinic-based care supplemented with community support or standard clinic-based care alone, stratified by country and clinic, in permuted block sizes of ten. Clinic plus community support consisted of screening for serum cryptococcal antigen combined with antifungal therapy for patients testing antigen positive, weekly home visits for the first 4 weeks on ART by lay workers to provide support, and in Tanzania alone, re-screening for tuberculosis at 6-8 weeks after ART initiation. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 12 months, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry, number ISCRTN 20410413. FINDINGS: Between Feb 9, 2012, and Sept 30, 2013, 1001 patients were randomly assigned to clinic plus community support and 998 to standard care. 89 (9%) of 1001 participants in the clinic plus community support group did not receive their assigned intervention, and 11 (1%) of 998 participants in the standard care group received a home visit or a cryptococcal antigen screen rather than only standard care. At 12 months, 25 (2%) of 1001 participants in the clinic plus community support group and 24 (2%) of 998 participants in the standard care group had been lost to follow-up, and were censored at their last visit for the primary analysis. At 12 months, 134 (13%) of 1001 participants in the clinic plus community support group had died compared with 180 (18%) of 998 in the standard care group. Mortality was 28% (95% CI 10-43) lower in the clinic plus community support group than in standard care group (p=0.004). INTERPRETATION: Screening and pre-emptive treatment for cryptococcal infection combined with a short initial period of adherence support after initiation of ART could substantially reduce mortality in HIV programmes in Africa.

      <td>Characterization of HIV drug resistance mutations among patients failing first-line antiretroviral therapy from a tertiary referral center in Lusaka, Zambia.</td>
      <td>In settings of resource constraint, an understanding of HIV drug resistance can guide antiretroviral therapy (ART) at switch to second-line therapy. To determine the prevalence of such HIV drug resistance mutations (HIV DRM), we used an in-house sequencing assay in the pol gene (protease and partial reverse transcriptase) in a cohort of patients suspected of failing a first-line regimen, which in Zambia comprises two nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Our analysis cohort (n = 68) was referred to the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka from November 2009 to October 2012. Median duration on first-line ART to suspected treatment failure was 3.2 years (IQR 1.7-4.7 years). The majority of patients (95%) harbored HIV-1 subtype C virus. Analysis of reverse transcriptase revealed M184V (88%), K103N/S (32%), and Y181C/I/V (41%) DRMs, with the latter conferring reduced susceptibility to the salvage therapy candidates etravirine and rilpivirine. Three patients (5%) had major protease inhibitor (PI) resistance mutations: all three had the V82A mutation, and one patient (Clade J virus) had a concurrent M46I, Q58E, and L76V DRM. HIV-1 genotyping revealed major and minor DRMs as well as high levels of polymorphisms in subtype C isolates from patients failing first-line antiretroviral therapy. Closer monitoring of DRM mutations at first-line failure can inform clinicians about future options for salvage therapy.</td>

      <td>HIV-infected women seeking early infant HIV diagnosis (EID) services in Malawi were asked about factors potentially associated with returning for EID results. Many (33.3%) infants failed to complete the EID process because of time and costs required for multiple visits. Infants of mothers receiving antiretroviral treatment were less likely to drop out (adjusted risk ratio 0.51), suggesting that EID completion may improve in programs providing antiretroviral treatment to all pregnant women.</td>

      <td>Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in rural Uganda: modelling effectiveness and impact of scaling-up PMTCT services.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The reported coverage of any antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) has increased in sub-Saharan Africa in recent years, but was still only 60% in 2010. However, the coverage estimate is subject to overestimations since it only considers enrolment and not completion of the PMTCT programme. The PMTCT programme is complex as it builds on a cascade of sequential interventions that should take place to reduce mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV: starting with antenatal care (ANC), HIV testing, and ARVs for the woman and the baby. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to estimate the number of children infected with HIV in a district population, using empirical data on uptake of PMTCT components combined with data on MTCT rates. DESIGN: This study is based on a population-based cohort of pregnant women recruited in the Iganga-Mayuge Health and Demographic Surveillance Site in rural Uganda 2008-2010. We later modelled different scenarios assuming increased uptake of specific PMTCT components to estimate the impact on MTCT for each scenario. RESULTS: In this setting, HIV infections in children could be reduced by 28% by increasing HIV testing capacity at health facilities to ensure 100% testing among women seeking ANC. Providing ART to all women who received ARV prophylaxis would give an 18% MTCT reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the urgency in scaling-up universal access to HIV testing at all ANC facilities, and the potential gains of early enrolment of all pregnant women on antiretroviral treatment for PMTCT. Further, to determine the effectiveness of PMTCT programmes in different settings, it is crucial to analyse at what stages of the PMTCT cascade that dropouts occur to target interventions accordingly.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate markers of iron status and inflammation/oxidative stress in maternal and cord blood (CB) of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women as potential mechanisms for poor outcomes among HIV-exposed, uninfected (HEU) infants. METHODS: Maternal venous blood and CB specimens were obtained from 87 pregnant women (45 HIV-infected and 42 HIV-uninfected) enrolled at Kalafong Hospital, Pretoria, South Africa. Iron status [serum iron, ferritin and transferrin concentrations, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) concentration and the sTfR/log ferritin (sTfR/F) index], antenatal exposure to inflammation (CB C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 concentrations and haptoglobin switch-on status) and oxidative stress [total radical trapping ability of CB plasma (TRAP) and chronic oxidative stress (soluble receptor of advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) concentration] were assessed in laboratory studies. RESULTS: There were no differences between the HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected groups in maternal haematological and iron indices, except that HIV-infected mothers had decreased white blood cell counts (P = 0.048) and increased serum ferritin concentrations (P = 0.032). Ferritin levels were significantly higher in CB than in maternal blood (P < 0.001) in both groups and further elevated in the CB of HEU infants (P = 0.044). There was also an inverse relationship between CB sTfR/F index and sRAGE (r = -0.43; P = 0.003) in the HIV-infected but not in the HIV-uninfected group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed for the first time that ferritin was significantly elevated in CB of HEU infants. The inverse relationship between sTfR/F index and sRAGE in CB suggests that chronic oxidative stress or RAGE axis activation in HIV-infected mothers may play a role in modulating ferritin levels.</td>

      <td>Improvement in mortality and retention among adult HIV-infected patients in the first 12 months of antiretroviral therapy in Dodoma urban district, Tanzania.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To determine mortality and retention in ART programmes in Tanzania, between 2010 and 2013. METHODS: Retrospective routinely collected data were analysed from people starting ART in the period 2010-2013. Mortality and retention over the first 12 months on ART were compared across the 4 years, and adjustment was made for individual level potential confounders. RESULTS: Data from 3844 people (70.6% female) starting ART were analysed. Mortality in the first year declined from 11.4% in 2010 to 4.9% in 2013, and retention after 12 months increased from 77.8% in 2010 to 98.1% in 2013. Mortality was inversely associated with CD4 count, lowest among those with CD4 350+ cells/mul [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.03], associated with male sex (AOR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.39-2.31), but not age. Lost to follow-up (LTFU) was lowest among those with CD4 = 350+ cells/mul AOR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.10-0.30), but not associated with age or sex, and higher in urban health facilities (AOR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.15-3.09). After adjustment for individual level characteristics, there was a statistically significant yearly improvement in mortality (AOR = 0.31, 95% CI (0.21-0.44) and LTFU (AOR = 0.06, 95% CI 0.04-0.10). CONCLUSION: Mortality and retention in the first 12 months on ART have significantly improved over the 4 years from 2010 to 2013. These improvements may indicate better services, earlier initiation on ART, and strengthened systems to provide ART in Tanzania. These results refute the worries that earlier initiation on ART might lead to lower retention in the ART programme.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: Academic Model Providing Access To Healthcare (AMPATH) program provides comprehensive HIV care and treatment services. Approximately, 30% of patients have become lost to follow-up (LTFU). We sought to actively trace and identify outcomes for a sample of these patients. METHODS: LTFU was defined as missing a scheduled visit by >/=3 months. A randomly selected sample of 17% of patients identified as LTFU between January 2009 and June 2011 was generated, with sample stratification on age, antiretroviral therapy (ART) status at last visit, and facility. Chart reviews were conducted followed by active tracing. Tracing was completed by trained HIV-positive outreach workers July 2011 to February 2012. Outcomes were compared between adults and children and by ART status. RESULTS: Of 14,811 LTFU patients, 2540 were randomly selected for tracing (2179 adults, 1071 on ART). The chart reviews indicated that 326 (12.8%) patients were not actually LTFU. Outcomes for 71% of sampled patients were determined including 85% of those physically traced. Of those with known outcomes, 21% had died, whereas 29% had disengaged from care for various reasons. The remaining patients had moved away (n = 458, 25%) or were still receiving HIV care (n = 443 total, 25%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of a large-scale sampling-based approach. A significant proportion of patients were found not to be LTFU, and further, high numbers of patients who were LTFU could not be located. Over a quarter of patients disengaged from care for various reasons including access challenges and familial influences.</td>

      <td>HIV-positive-to-HIV-positive kidney transplantation--results at 3 to 5 years.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The outcome of kidney transplantation in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients who receive organs from HIV-negative donors has been reported to be similar to the outcome in HIV-negative recipients. We report the outcomes at 3 to 5 years in HIV-positive patients who received kidneys from HIV-positive deceased donors. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, nonrandomized study of kidney transplantation in HIV-infected patients who had a CD4 T-cell count of 200 per cubic millimeter or higher and an undetectable plasma HIV RNA level. All the patients were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). The patients received kidneys from deceased donors who tested positive for HIV with the use of fourth-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at the time of referral. All the donors either had received no ART previously or had received only first-line ART. RESULTS: From September 2008 through February 2014, a total of 27 HIV-positive patients underwent kidney transplantation. Survivors were followed for a median of 2.4 years. The rate of survival among the patients was 84% at 1 year, 84% at 3 years, and 74% at 5 years. The corresponding rates of graft survival were 93%, 84%, and 84%. (If a patient died with a functioning graft, the calculation was performed as if the graft had survived.) Rejection rates were 8% at 1 year and 22% at 3 years. HIV infection remained well controlled, with undetectable virus in blood after the transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplantation from an HIV-positive donor appears to be an additional treatment option for HIV-infected patients requiring renal-replacement therapy.

      <td>High prevalence of the K65R mutation in HIV-1 subtype C infected patients failing tenofovir-based first-line regimens in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Tenofovir (TDF) has replaced stavudine (d4T) as the preferred nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) in first-line regimens in South Africa, but limited information is available on the resistance patterns that develop after the introduction of TDF. This study investigated the antiretroviral drug resistance patterns in South African HIV-1 subtype C-infected patients failing stavudine- (d4T) and tenofovir- (TDF) based first-line regimens and assess the suitability of TDF as the preferred first-line nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). METHODS: Resistance patterns of HIV-1 from 160 adult patients virologically failing TDF- (n = 80) and d4T- (n = 80) based first-line regimens were retrospectively analyzed. The pol gene was sequenced using an in-house protocol and mutations were analysed using the IAS-USA 2014 Drug Resistance Mutation list. RESULTS: Compared to d4T-exposed patients (n = 7), patients failing on a TDF-containing regimen (n = 43) were almost 5 times more likely to present with a K65R mutation (aRR 4.86 95% CI 2.29 - 10.34). Y115F was absent in the d4T group, and detected in 13.8% (n = 11) of TDF-exposed patients, p = 0.0007. Virus from 9 of the 11 patients (82.0%) who developed the Y115F mutation also developed K65R. Intermediate or high-level resistance to most NRTIs was common in the TDF-treatment group, but these patients twice more likely to remain susceptible to AZT as compared to those exposed to d4T (aRR 2.09 95% CI 1.13 - 3.90). CONCLUSION: The frequency of the TDF induced K65R mutation was higher in our setting compared to non-subtype C dominated countries. However, despite the higher frequency of cross-resistance to NRTIs, most patients remained susceptible to AZT, which is reflected in the South African treatment guidelines that recommend AZT as an essential component of second-line regimens.</td>

      <td>Low resistance to first and second line anti-tuberculosis drugs among treatment naive pulmonary tuberculosis patients in southwestern Uganda.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: There are limited data on region-specific drug susceptibility of tuberculosis (TB) in Uganda. We performed resistance testing on specimens collected from treatment-naive patients with pulmonary TB in Southwestern Uganda for first and second line anti-TB drugs. We sought to provide data to guide regional recommendations for empiric TB therapy. METHODS: Archived isolates, obtained from patients at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital from February 2009 to February 2013, were tested for resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin using the MTBDRplus and Xpert MTB/RIF assays. A subset of randomly selected isolates was tested for second line agents, including fluoroquinolones (FQs), aminoglycosides, cyclic peptides, and ethambutol using the MTBDRsl assay. We performed confirmatory testing for FQ resistance using repeated MTBDRsl, the Mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) assay, and sequencing of the gyrA and gyrB genes. RESULTS: We tested isolates from 190 patients. The cohort had a median age of 33 years (IQR 26-43), 69% (131/190) were male, and the HIV prevalence was 42% (80/190). No isolates (0/190) were rifampicin-resistant and only 1/190 (0.5%) was isoniazid-resistant. Among 92 isolates tested for second-line drug resistance, 71 (77%) had interpretable results, of which none were resistant to aminoglycosides, cyclic peptides or ethambutol. Although 7 (10%) initially tested as resistant to FQs by the MTBDRsl assay, they were confirmed as susceptible by repeat MTBDRsl testing as well as by MGIT and gyrase gene sequencing. CONCLUSION: We found no MDR-TB and no resistance to ethambutol, FQs, or injectable anti-TB drugs in treatment naive patients with pulmonary TB in Southwestern Uganda. Standard treatment guidelines for susceptible TB should be adequate for most patients with TB in this population. Where possible, molecular susceptibility testing methods should be routinely validated by culture methods.</td>

      <td>Delays, interruptions, and losses from prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV services during antenatal care in Johannesburg, South Africa: a cohort analysis.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Between 2010-2013, South Africa implemented WHO 'Option A' for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT), where all HIV-infected pregnant women (from 14 weeks gestation) received zidovudine (AZT) as ARV prophylaxis and initiated CD4 testing at their first antenatal care (ANC) visit. After returning for a second visit to collect CD4 results, women with CD4 counts </= 350 were referred to the ART clinic and fast-tracked for initiation on lifelong ART while continuing to visit the ANC clinic every four weeks. Women with CD4 counts >350 were dispensed daily AZT prophylaxis at monthly follow up visits (every 4 weeks). The primary objective of this study was to evaluate adherence of HIV-infected pregnant women to recommended PMTCT services at and after their first antenatal care (ANC) visit. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study from August 2012 to February 2013 at two primary health care clinics in Johannesburg, South Africa using routinely collected clinic data from first ANC visit for up to 60 days. RESULTS: Of the 158 patients newly diagnosed with HIV at their first ANC visit, records indicated that 139 women initiated CD4 testing during their first ANC visit. 52 patients (33% of 158) did not return again to the clinic within 60 days. Of the 118 (84% of 139) women with known gestational age > 13 weeks and known Hb >/= 8 g/dl who should have received a 4-week supply of daily AZT at first ANC visit, 81 women (69% of 118) had a record of AZT being dispensed. Among the 139 women with CD4 results, 72 (52%) were eligible for lifelong ART (CD4 count </=350); however, only 2 initiated ART within 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Loss to initiation of both single and triple ARV therapy, loss to follow-up, and treatment interruptions were common during ANC care for pregnant women with HIV after their first ANC visit.</td>

      <td>Outcomes Up to 12 Months After Treatment With Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure for Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Among HIV-Infected Women.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: HIV-infected women may have higher rates of recurrent cervical precancer after treatment. Knowledge about rates and predictors of recurrence could impact guidelines and program planning, especially in low-resource settings. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study in Western Kenya, we followed HIV-infected women at 6 and 12 months after treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or greater (CIN2+) after treatment with loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). All women underwent follow-up colposcopy with biopsy as indicated for the diagnosis of CIN2+. We calculated the incidence and predictors of primary disease recurrence after treatment. RESULTS: Among the 284 women who underwent LEEP and had at least 1 follow-up visit, there were 37 (13%) cases of CIN2+ detected by 12-month follow-up. Four (10.8%) of the recurrences were invasive cancer, all stage IA1. The 6- and 12-month rates of recurrence were 13.7 and 12.8 cases per 100 person-years of follow-up, respectively. Antiretroviral therapy use did not significantly impact the rate of recurrence (hazard ratio: 1.24, 95% confidence interval: 0.59 to 2.79). The only significant predictor of recurrence in the multivariate analysis was CD4(+) nadir <200 cells per cubic millimeter (adjusted hazard ratio: 3.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.22 to 8.08). DISCUSSION: The overall rate of treatment failure within a year of LEEP was low in this cohort of HIV-infected women. Among the women with recurrence, there was a significant amount of invasive cancer. The relatively high rate of cancer after treatment suggests that HIV-infected women merit continued close follow-up after treatment.</td>

      <td>Clinical associations of white matter damage in cART-treated HIV-positive children in South Africa.</td>
      <td>A range of factors contributes to white matter damage in vertically infected HIV-positive children. These may include combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) regimen, sociodemographic factors, nutritional-hematological status, HIV-relevant clinical variables, and cognitive functioning. We explored associations between a number of these factors and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures in 50 cART-treated children aged 6 to 15 years. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusion (MD), radial diffusion (RD), and axial diffusion (AD) were derived from 48 cerebral white matter regions. Significant associations between a number of the clinical variables and white matter integrity were found. Decreased FA, a measure of neuronal damage, was associated with being on second-line cART, low hemoglobin, and younger age. Children with increased MD, a measure of neuronal damage, were younger, had reduced albumin and hemoglobin, and increased viral load. Decreased AD, a measure of axonal damage, was associated with increased viral load and total protein, decreased albumin and hemoglobin, younger age, poorer fronto-striatal cognition, and being on second-line cART. Increased RD, a measure of myelin loss, was associated with younger age, low current CD4 count, low albumin and hemoglobin, and higher viral load and total protein. The current findings underline the possible association of first-line treatment failure with white matter brain dysfunction in pediatric neuroHIV and the importance of examining the effects of HIV disease in the context of treatable clinical variables such as anemia and nutritional status.</td>

      <td>Safe and efficacious artemisinin-based combination treatments for African pregnant women with malaria: a multicentre randomized control trial.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic and symptomatic malaria during pregnancy has consequences for both mother and her offspring. Unfortunately, there is insufficient information on the safety and efficacy of most antimalarials in pregnancy. Indeed, clinical trials assessing antimalarial treatments systematically exclude pregnancy for fear of teratogenicity and embryotoxicity. The little available information originates from South East Asia while in sub-Saharan Africa such information is still limited and needs to be provided. DESIGN: A Phase 3, non-inferiority, multicentre, randomized, open-label clinical trial on safety and efficacy of 4 ACT when administered during pregnancy was carried out in 4 African countries: Burkina Faso, Ghana, Malawi and Zambia. This is a four arm trial using a balanced incomplete block design. Pregnant women diagnosed with malaria are randomised to receive either amodiaquine-artesunate (AQ-AS), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQ), artemether-lumefantrine (AL), or mefloquine-artesunate (MQAS). They are actively followed up until day 63 post-treatment and then monthly until 4-6 weeks post-delivery. The offspring is visited at the time of the first birthday. The primary endpoint is treatment failure (PCR adjusted) at day 63 and safety profiles. Secondary endpoints included PCR unadjusted treatment failure up to day 63, gametocyte carriage, Hb changes, placenta malaria, mean birth weight and low birth weight. The primary statistical analysis will use the combined data from all 4 centres, with adjustment for any centre effects, using an additive model for the response rates. This will allow the assessment of all 6 possible pair-wise treatment comparisons using all available data. DISCUSSION: The strength of this trial is the involvement of several African countries, increasing the generalisability of the results. In addition, it assesses most ACTs currently available, determining their relative '-value-' compared to others. The balanced incomplete block design was chosen because using all 4-arms in each site would have increased complexity in terms of implementation. Excluding HIV-positive pregnant women on antiretroviral drugs may be seen as a limitation because of the possible interactions between antiretroviral and antimalarial treatments. Nevertheless, the results of this trial will provide the evidence base for the formulation of malaria treatment policy for pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa.</td>

      <td>Risk factors and mortality associated with resistance to first-line antiretroviral therapy: multicentric cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Understanding the factors associated with HIV drug resistance development and subsequent mortality is important to improve clinical patient management. METHODS: Analysis of individual electronic health records from 4 HIV programs in Malawi, Kenya, Uganda, and Cambodia, linked to data from 5 cross-sectional virological studies conducted among patients receiving first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) for >/=6 months. Adjusted logistic and Cox-regression models were used to identify risk factors for drug resistance and subsequent mortality. RESULTS: A total of 2257 patients (62% women) were included. At ART initiation, median CD4 cell count was 100 cells per microliter (interquartile range, 40-165). A median of 25.1 months after therapy start, 18% of patients had >/=400 and 12.4% >/=1000 HIV RNA copies per milliliter. Of 180 patients with drug resistance data, 83.9% had major resistance(s) to nucleoside or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and 74.4% dual resistance. Resistance to nevirapine, lamivudine, and efavirenz was common, and 6% had etravirine cross-resistance. Risk factors for resistance were young age (<35 years), low CD4 cell count (<200 cells/muL), and poor treatment adherence. During 4978 person-years of follow-up after virological testing (median = 31.8 months), 57 deaths occurred [rate = 1.14/100 person-years; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88 to 1.48]. Mortality was higher in patients with resistance (hazard ratio = 2.08; 95% CI: 1.07 to 4.07 vs. <400 copies/mL), and older age (hazard ratio = 2.41; 95% CI: 1.24 to 4.71 for >/=43 vs. </=34 years), and lower in those receiving ART for >30 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underline the importance of optimal treatment adherence and adequate virological response monitoring and emphasize the need for resistance surveillance initiatives even in HIV programs achieving high virological suppression rates.</td>

      <td>Population-based surveillance of HIV drug resistance emerging on treatment and associated factors at sentinel antiretroviral therapy sites in Namibia.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization (WHO) prospective surveys of acquired HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) evaluate HIVDR emerging after the first year of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and associated factors. METHODS: Consecutive ART starters in 2009 were enrolled at 3 sentinel sites in Namibia. Genotyping was performed at start and after 12 months in patients with HIV viral load (VL) >1000 copies per mL. HIVDR outcomes were: HIVDR prevention (VL </=1000 copies/mL), possible HIVDR (VL >1000 copies/mL without detectable HIVDR or loss to follow-up or ART stop), and HIVDR (VL >1000 copies/mL with detectable HIVDR). Adherence was assessed using medication possession ratio (MPR). RESULTS: Of 394 starters, at 12 months, 80% were on first-line ART, 1% died, 4% transferred out, 1% stopped ART, <1% switched to second-line, and 15% were lost to follow-up. Among patients on first-line, 77% had VL testing, and 94% achieved VL </=1000 copies per mL. At baseline, 7% had HIVDR. After 12 months, among patients with VL testing, 5% had HIVDR. A majority of patients failing therapy had high-level resistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors but none to protease inhibitors. All sites achieved the WHO target of >/=70% HIVDR prevention. Factors associated with not achieving HIVDR prevention were: baseline resistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [odds ratio (OR) 3.0, P = 0.023], WHO stage 3 or 4 at baseline (OR 2.0, P = 0.012), and MPR <75% (OR 4.9, P = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Earlier ART initiation and removal of barriers to on-time drug pickups may help to prevent HIVDR. These data inform decisions at national and global levels on the effectiveness of first- and second-line regimens.</td>

      <td>Mobile health for early retention in HIV care: a qualitative study in Kenya (WelTel Retain).</td>
      <td>Many people newly diagnosed with HIV are lost to follow-up before timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). A randomised controlled trial (RCT), WelTel Kenya1, demonstrated the effectiveness of the WelTel text messaging intervention to improve clinical outcomes among patients initiating ART. In preparation for WelTel Retain, an RCT that will evaluate the effect of the intervention to retain patients in care immediately following HIV diagnosis, we conducted an informative qualitative study with people living with HIV (n = 15) and healthcare providers (HCP) (n = 5) in October 2012. Study objectives included exploring the experiences of people living with HIV who have attempted to engage in HIV care, the use of cell phones in everyday life, and perceptions of communicating via text message with HCP. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling. Semi-structured, qualitative interviews were conducted and recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using NVivo software. Analysis was guided by the Theory of Reasoned Action and the Technology Acceptance Model. Results indicate that while individuals have many motivators for engaging in care after diagnosis, structural and individual barriers including poverty, depression and fear of stigma prevent them from doing so. All participants had access to a mobile phone, and most were comfortable communicating through text messages, or were willing to learn. Both people living with HIV and HCP felt that increased communication via the text messaging intervention has the potential to enable early identification of problems, leading to timely problem solving that may improve retention and engagement in care during the first year after diagnosis.</td>

      <td>The Mycobacterium tuberculosis Uganda II family and resistance to first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs in Uganda.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The global increase in the burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) underscores an urgent need for data on factors involved in generation and spread of TB drug resistance. We performed molecular analyses on a representative sample of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates. Basing on findings of the molecular epidemiological study in Kampala, we hypothesized that the predominant MTB strain lineage in Uganda is negatively associated with anti-TB drug resistance and we set out to test this hypothesis. METHODS: We extracted DNA from mycobacterial isolates collected from smear-positive TB patients in the national TB drug resistance survey and carried out IS6110-PCR. To identify MTB lineages/sub lineages RT-PCR SNP was performed using specific primers and hybridization probes and the 'melting curve' analysis was done to distinguish the Uganda II family from other MTB families. The primary outcome was the distribution of the Uganda II family and its associations with anti-TB drug resistance and HIV infection. RESULTS: Out of the 1537 patients enrolled, MTB isolates for 1001 patients were available for SNP analysis for identification of Uganda II family, of which 973 (97%) had conclusive RT-PCR results. Of these 422 (43.4%) were of the Uganda II family, mostly distributed in the south west zone (55.0%; OR = 4.6 for comparison with other zones; 95% CI 2.83-7.57; p < 0.001) but occurred in each of the other seven geographic zones at varying levels. Compared to the Uganda II family, other genotypes as a group were more likely to be resistant to any anti-TB drug (OR(adj) =2.9; 95% CI 1.63-5.06; p = 0.001) or MDR (OR(adj) 4.9; 95% CI, 1.15-20.60; p = 0.032), even after adjusting for geographic zone, patient category, sex, residence and HIV status. It was commonest in the 25-34 year age group 159/330 (48.2%). No association was observed between Uganda II family and HIV infection. CONCLUSION: The Uganda II family is a major cause of morbidity due to TB in all NTLP zones in Uganda. It is less likely to be resistant to anti-TB drugs than other MTB strain lineages.</td>

      <td>Characteristics and outcomes of HIV-infected youth and young adolescents enrolled in HIV care in Kenya.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The number of youth and adolescents (10-24 years) with HIV infection has increased substantially presenting unique challenges to effective health service delivery. METHODS: We examined routinely collected patient-level data for antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naive HIV-infected patients, aged 10-24 years, enrolled in care during 2006-2011 at 109 ICAP-supported health facilities in three provinces in Kenya. Loss to follow-up (LTF) was defined as having no clinic visit for 12 months prior to ART initiation (pre-ART) and 6 months for ART patients. Competing risk and Kaplan-Meier estimators were used to calculate LTF and death rates. Sub-distributional and Cox proportional-hazards models were used to identify potential predictors of death and LTF. RESULTS: Overall 22 832 patients were enrolled in care at 10-24 years of age, 69.5% were aged 20-24 years, and 82% were female. Median CD4(+) cell count was 332 cells/mul (interquartile range 153-561); 70.8% were WHO stage I/II. Young adolescents (10-14 years) had more advanced WHO stage and lower median CD4(+) cell count compared to youth (15-24 years) at enrollment (284 vs. 340 cells/mul; P < 0.0001). Cumulative incidence of LTF and death at 24 months for pre-ART patients was 46.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 45.4-46.8%) and 2.1% (95% CI 1.9-2.3%), respectively. For those on ART, 32.2% (95% CI 31.1-33.3%) were LTF and 3.9% (95% CI 1.7-2.3%) died within 24 months. LTF among pre-ART and ART patients was twice as high among youth compared to young adolescents. CONCLUSION: LTF of young people with HIV in this Kenyan cohort was high and notably greater among youth compared to young adolescents. Novel strategies targeting these populations are urgently needed to improve retention.</td>

      <td>Increasing the use of second-line therapy is a cost-effective approach to prevent the spread of drug-resistant HIV: a mathematical modelling study.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Earlier antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation reduces HIV-1 incidence. This benefit may be offset by increased transmitted drug resistance (TDR), which could limit future HIV treatment options. We analyze the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of strategies to reduce TDR. METHODS: We develop a deterministic mathematical model representing Kampala, Uganda, to predict the prevalence of TDR over a 10-year period. We then compare the impact on TDR and cost-effectiveness of: (1) introduction of pre-therapy genotyping; (2) doubling use of second-line treatment to 80% (50-90%) of patients with confirmed virological failure on first-line ART; and (3) increasing viral load monitoring from yearly to twice yearly. An intervention can be considered cost-effective if it costs less than three times the gross domestic product per capita per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, or less than $3420 in Uganda. RESULTS: The prevalence of TDR is predicted to rise from 6.7% (interquartile range [IQR] 6.2-7.2%) in 2014, to 6.8% (IQR 6.1-7.6%), 10.0% (IQR 8.9-11.5%) and 11.1% (IQR 9.7-13.0%) in 2024 if treatment is initiated at a CD4 <350, <500, or immediately, respectively. The absolute number of TDR cases is predicted to decrease 4.4-8.1% when treating earlier compared to treating at CD4 <350 due to the preventative effects of earlier treatment. Most cases of TDR can be averted by increasing second-line treatment (additional 7.1-10.2% reduction), followed by increased viral load monitoring (<2.7%) and pre-therapy genotyping (<1.0%). Only increasing second-line treatment is cost-effective, ranging from $1612 to $2234 (IQR $450-dominated) per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: While earlier treatment initiation will result in a predicted increase in the proportion of patients infected with drug-resistant HIV, the absolute numbers of patients infected with drug-resistant HIV is predicted to decrease. Increasing use of second-line treatment to all patients with confirmed failure on first-line therapy is a cost-effective approach to reduce TDR. Improving access to second-line ART is therefore a major priority.</td>

      <td>HIV type 1 drug resistance patterns among patients failing first and second line antiretroviral therapy in Nairobi, Kenya.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The ever-expanding rollout of antiretroviral therapy in poor resource settings without routine virological monitoring has been accompanied with development of drug resistance that has resulted in limited treatment success. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with one time viral load was conducted during the period between 2012 and 2013 to determine treatment failure and drug resistance mutations among adults receiving first-line (44) (3TC_d4T/AZT_NVP/EFV) and second-line (20) (3TC/AZT/LPV/r) in Nairobi, Kenya. HIV-1 pol-RT genotyping for drug resistance was performed using an in-house protocol. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were recruited (mean age 36.9 yrs.) during the period between 2012 and 2013 of the 44 adult patients failing first-line 24 (40.9%) had drug resistance mutations. Eight (8) patients had NRTI resistance mutations with NAMS M184V (54.2%) and K65R (8.4%) mutations being the highest followed by TAMs T215Y and K70R (12.5%). In addition, among patients failing second-line (20), six patients (30%) had NNRTI resistance; two patients on K103N and G190A mutations while V106A, Y184V, A98G, Y181C mutations per patient were also detected. However, for NRTI two patients had TAM T215Y. M184V mutation occurred in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings showed that HIV-1 drug resistance was significantly high in the study population. The detected accumulated resistance strains show that emergence of HIV drug resistance will continue to be a big challenge and should be given more attention as the scale up of treatment in the country continues.</td>

      <td>The epidemiological impact of HIV antiretroviral therapy on malaria in children.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine the epidemiological effectiveness of a first-line antiretroviral regimen with HIV protease inhibitor for preventing recurrent malaria in children under the range of HIV prevalence levels and malaria transmission intensities encountered in sub-Saharan Africa. DESIGN: A dynamic model of malaria transmission was developed using clinical data on the protease inhibitor extended posttreatment prophylactic effect of the antimalarial treatment, artemether-lumefantrine, in addition to parameter estimates from the literature. METHODS: To evaluate the benefits of HIV protease inhibitors on the health burden of recurrent malaria among children, we constructed a dynamic model of malaria transmission to both HIV-positive and HIV-negative children, parameterized by data from a recent clinical trial. The model was then evaluated under varying malaria transmission and HIV prevalence settings to determine the health benefits of HIV protease inhibitors in the context of artemether-lumefantrine treatment of malaria in children. RESULTS: Comparing scenarios of low, intermediate and high newborn HIV prevalence, in a range of malaria transmission settings, our dynamic model predicts that artemether-lumefantrine with HIV protease inhibitor based regimens prevents 0.03-0.10, 5.2-13.0 and 25.5-65.8 annual incidences of malaria per 1000 children, respectively. In addition, HIV protease inhibitors save 0.002-0.006, 0.22-0.8, 1.04-4.3 disability-adjusted life-years per 1000 children annually. Considering only HIV-infected children, HIV protease inhibitors avert between 278 and 1043 annual incidences of malaria per 1000 children. CONCLUSION: The use of HIV protease inhibitor based regimens as first-line antiretroviral therapy for HIV is an effective measure for reducing recurrent malaria among HIV-infected children in areas where HIV and malaria are coendemic, and artemether-lumefantrine is a first-line antimalarial.</td>

      <td>Family matters: Co-enrollment of family members into care is associated with improved outcomes for HIV-infected women initiating antiretroviral therapy.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Although there is widespread interest in understanding how models of care for delivering antiretroviral therapy (ART) may influence patient outcomes, family-focused approaches have received little attention. In particular, there have been few investigations of whether the co-enrollment of HIV-infected family members may improve adult ART outcomes over time. METHODS: We examined the association between co-enrollment of HIV-infected family members into care and outcomes of women initiating ART in 12 HIV care and treatment programs across sub-Saharan Africa. Using data from the mother-to-child transmission-(MTCT) Plus Initiative, women starting ART were categorized according to the co-enrollment of an HIV-infected partner and/or HIV-infected child within the same program. Mortality and loss to follow-up were assessed for up to 5 years after women's ART initiation. RESULTS: Of the 2877 women initiating ART included in the analysis, 31% (n = 880) had at least 1 HIV-infected family member enrolled into care at the same program, including 24% (n = 689) who had an HIV-infected male partner, and 10% (n = 295) who had an HIV-infected child co-enrolled. There was no significant difference in the risk of death of women by family co-enrollment status (P = 0.286). However, the risk of loss to follow-up was greatest among women who did not have an HIV-infected family member co-enrolled (19% after 36 months on ART) compared with women who had an HIV-infected family member co-enrolled (3%-8% after 36 months on ART) (P < 0.001). These associations persisted after adjustment for demographic and clinical covariates and were consistent across countries and care programs. DISCUSSION: These data provide novel evidence for the association between adult outcomes on ART and co-enrollment of HIV-infected family members into care at the same program. Interventions that build on women's family contexts warrant further consideration in both research and policies to promote retention in ART services across sub-Saharan Africa.</td>

      <td>The combination of pill count and self-reported adherence is a strong predictor of first-line ART failure for adults in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Suboptimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a strong predictor of virologic failure (VF) among people with HIV. Various methods such as patient self-report, pill counts and pharmacy refills have been utilized to monitor adherence. However, there are limited data on the accuracy of combining methods to better predict VF in routine clinical settings. We examined various methods to assess adherence including pill count, medication possession ratio (MPR), and self-reported adherence in order to determine which was most highly associated with VF after > 6 months on ART. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a case-control study. At enrollment, pharmacy refill data were collected retrospectively from the medical chart, pill counts were completed to derive a pill count adherence ratio (PCAR) and a self-report questionnaire was administered to all participants. Parametric smooth splines and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses were carried out to assess the accuracy of the adherence methods. RESULTS: 458 patients were enrolled from October 2010 to June 2012. Of these, 158 (34.50%) experienced VF (cases) and 300 (65.50%) were controls. The median (IQR) PCAR was 1.10 (0.99-1.14) for cases and 1.13 (1.08-1.18) for controls (p < 0.0001). The median MPR was 1.00 (0.97-1.07) for cases and 1.03 (0.96-1.07) for controls (p = 0.83). Combination of PCAR and self-reported questions was highly associated with VF. CONCLUSION: In this setting, a combination of pill count adherence and self-report adherence questions had the highest diagnostic accuracy for VF. Further validation of this simple, low-cost combination is warranted in large prospective studies.</td>

      <td>Self-transfer and mortality amongst adults lost to follow-up in ART programmes in low- and middle-income countries: systematic review and meta-analysis.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To ascertain estimates of adult patients, recorded as lost to follow-up (LTFU) within antiretroviral treatment (ART) programmes, who have self-transferred care, died or truly stopped ART in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Science Direct, LILACS, IndMed and AIM databases (2003-2013) and IAS/AIDS conference abstracts (2011-2013) were searched for tracing studies reporting the proportion of traced patients found to have self-transferred, died or stopped ART. These estimates were then combined using random-effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias was assessed through subgroup and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Twenty eight studies were eligible for inclusion, reporting true outcomes for 10,806 traced patients attending approximately 258 ART facilities. None were from outside sub-Saharan Africa. Twenty three studies reported 4.5-54.4% traced LTFU patients self-transferring care, providing a pooled estimate of 18.6% (95% CI 15.8-22.0%). A significant positive association was found between rates of self-transfer and LTFU in the ART cohort. The pooled estimates for unreported deaths were 38.8% (95% CI 30.8-46.8%; 27 studies) and 28.6% (95% CI 21.9-36.0%; 20 studies) for patients stopping ART. A significant decrease in unreported deaths from 50.0% (95% CI 41.5-58.4%) to 30.0% (95% CI 21.1-38.9%) was found comparing study periods before and after 31 December 2007. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial unaccounted for transfers and deaths amongst patients LTFU confirms that retention and mortality is underestimated where the true outcomes of LTFU patients are not ascertained.</td>

      <td>HIV diversity and drug resistance from plasma and non-plasma analytes in a large treatment programme in western Kenya.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Antiretroviral resistance leads to treatment failure and resistance transmission. Resistance data in western Kenya are limited. Collection of non-plasma analytes may provide additional resistance information. METHODS: We assessed HIV diversity using the REGA tool, transmitted resistance by the WHO mutation list and acquired resistance upon first-line failure by the IAS-USA mutation list, at the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH), a major treatment programme in western Kenya. Plasma and four non-plasma analytes, dried blood-spots (DBS), dried plasma-spots (DPS), ViveST(TM)-plasma (STP) and ViveST-blood (STB), were compared to identify diversity and evaluate sequence concordance. RESULTS: Among 122 patients, 62 were treatment-naive and 60 treatment-experienced; 61% were female, median age 35 years, median CD4 182 cells/microL, median viral-load 4.6 log10 copies/mL. One hundred and ninety-six sequences were available for 107/122 (88%) patients, 58/62 (94%) treatment-naive and 49/60 (82%) treated; 100/122 (82%) plasma, 37/78 (47%) attempted DBS, 16/45 (36%) attempted DPS, 14/44 (32%) attempted STP from fresh plasma and 23/34 (68%) from frozen plasma, and 5/42 (12%) attempted STB. Plasma and DBS genotyping success increased at higher VL and shorter shipment-to-genotyping time. Main subtypes were A (62%), D (15%) and C (6%). Transmitted resistance was found in 1.8% of plasma sequences, and 7% combining analytes. Plasma resistance mutations were identified in 91% of treated patients, 76% NRTI, 91% NNRTI; 76% dual-class; 60% with intermediate-high predicted resistance to future treatment options; with novel mutation co-occurrence patterns. Nearly 88% of plasma mutations were identified in DBS, 89% in DPS and 94% in STP. Of 23 discordant mutations, 92% in plasma and 60% in non-plasma analytes were mixtures. Mean whole-sequence discordance from frozen plasma reference was 1.1% for plasma-DBS, 1.2% plasma-DPS, 2.0% plasma-STP and 2.3% plasma-STB. Of 23 plasma-STP discordances, one mutation was identified in plasma and 22 in STP (p<0.05). Discordance was inversely significantly related to VL for DBS. CONCLUSIONS: In a large treatment programme in western Kenya, we report high HIV-1 subtype diversity; low plasma transmitted resistance, increasing when multiple analytes were combined; and high-acquired resistance with unique mutation patterns. Resistance surveillance may be augmented by using non-plasma analytes for lower-cost genotyping in resource-limited settings.</td>

      <td>CryptoDex: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial of adjunctive dexamethasone in HIV-infected adults with cryptococcal meningitis: study protocol for a randomised control trial.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a severe AIDS-defining illness with 90-day case mortality as high as 70% in sub-Saharan Africa, despite treatment. It is the leading cause of death in HIV patients in Asia and Africa.No major advance has been made in the treatment of CM since the 1970s. The mainstays of induction therapy are amphotericin B and flucytosine, but these are often poorly available where the disease burden is highest. Adjunctive treatments, such as dexamethasone, have had dramatic effects on mortality in other neurologic infections, but are untested in CM. Given the high death rates in patients receiving current optimal treatment, and the lack of new agents on the horizon, adjuvant treatments, which offer the potential to reduce mortality in CM, should be tested.The principal research question posed by this study is as follows: does adding dexamethasone to standard antifungal therapy for CM reduce mortality? Dexamethasone is a cheap, readily available, and practicable intervention. METHOD: A double-blind placebo-controlled trial with parallel arms in which patients are randomised to receive either dexamethasone or placebo, in addition to local standard of care. The study recruits patients in both Asia and Africa to ensure the relevance of its results to the populations in which the disease burden is highest. The 10-week mortality risk in the control group is expected to be between 30% and 50%, depending on location, and the target hazard ratio of 0.7 corresponds to absolute risk reductions in mortality from 30% to 22%, or from 50% to 38%. Assuming an overall 10-week mortality of at least 30% in our study population, recruitment of 824 patients will be sufficient to observe the expected number of deaths. Allowing for some loss to follow-up, the total sample size for this study is 880 patients. To generate robust evidence across both continents, we aim to recruit roughly similar numbers of patients from each continent. The primary end point is 10-week mortality. Ethical approval has been obtained from Oxford University's Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OxTREC), and as locally mandated at each site.

      <td>Multi-country analysis of treatment costs for HIV/AIDS (MATCH): facility-level ART unit cost analysis in Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda, South Africa and Zambia.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Today's uncertain HIV funding landscape threatens to slow progress towards treatment goals. Understanding the costs of antiretroviral therapy (ART) will be essential for governments to make informed policy decisions about the pace of scale-up under the 2013 WHO HIV Treatment Guidelines, which increase the number of people eligible for treatment from 17.6 million to 28.6 million. The study presented here is one of the largest of its kind and the first to describe the facility-level cost of ART in a random sample of facilities in Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda, South Africa and Zambia. METHODS & FINDINGS: In 2010-2011, comprehensive data on one year of facility-level ART costs and patient outcomes were collected from 161 facilities, selected using stratified random sampling. Overall, facility-level ART costs were significantly lower than expected in four of the five countries, with a simple average of $208 per patient-year (ppy) across Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda and Zambia. Costs were higher in South Africa, at $682 ppy. This included medications, laboratory services, direct and indirect personnel, patient support, equipment and administrative services. Facilities demonstrated the ability to retain patients alive and on treatment at these costs, although outcomes for established patients (2-8% annual loss to follow-up or death) were better than outcomes for new patients in their first year of ART (77-95% alive and on treatment). CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrated that the facility-level costs of ART are lower than previously understood in these five countries. While limitations must be considered, and costs will vary across countries, this suggests that expanded treatment coverage may be affordable. Further research is needed to understand investment costs of treatment scale-up, non-facility costs and opportunities for more efficient resource allocation.</td>

      <td>Two-year death and loss to follow-up outcomes by source of referral to HIV care for HIV-infected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy in rural Mozambique.</td>
      <td>We studied patient outcomes by type of referral site following 2 years of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) during scale-up from June 2006 to July 2011 in Mozambique's rural Zambezia Province. Loss to follow-up (LTFU) was defined as no contact within 60 days after scheduled medication pickup. Endpoints included LTFU, mortality, and combined mortality/LTFU; we used Kaplan-Meier and cumulative incidence estimates. The referral site was the source of HIV testing. We modeled 2-year outcomes using Cox regression stratified by district, adjusting for sociodemographics and health status. Of 7,615 HIV-infected patients >/=15 years starting cART, 61% were female and the median age was 30 years. Two-year LTFU was 38.1% (95% CI: 36.9-39.3%) and mortality was 14.2% (95% CI 13.2-15.2%). Patients arrived from voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) sites (51%), general outpatient clinics (21%), antenatal care (8%), inpatient care (3%), HIV/tuberculosis/laboratory facilities (<4%), or other sources of referral (14%). Compared with VCT, patients referred from inpatient, tuberculosis, or antenatal care had higher hazards of LTFU. Adjusted hazard ratios (AHR; 95% CI) for 2-year mortality by referral site (VCT as referent) were inpatient 1.87 (1.36-2.58), outpatient 1.44 (1.11-1.85), and antenatal care 0.69 (0.43-1.11) and for mortality/LTFU were inpatient 1.60 (1.34-1.91), outpatient 1.17 (1.02-1.33), tuberculosis care 1.38 (1.08-1.75), and antenatal care 1.24 (1.06-1.44). That source of referral was associated with mortality/LTFU after adjusting for patient characteristics at cART initiation suggests that (1) additional unmeasured factors are influential, and (2) retention programs may benefit from targeting patient populations based on source of referral with focused counseling and/or social support.</td>

      <td>"It is all about the fear of being discriminated [against]...the person suffering from HIV will not be accepted": a qualitative study exploring the reasons for loss to follow-up among HIV-positive youth in Kisumu, Kenya.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Youth represent 40% of all new HIV infections in the world, 80% of which live in sub-Saharan Africa. Youth living with HIV (YLWH) are more likely to become lost to follow-up (LTFU) from care compared to all other age groups. This study explored the reasons for LTFU among YLWH in Kenya. METHODS: Data was collected from: (1) Focus group Discussions (n = 18) with community health workers who work with LTFU youth. (2) Semi-structured interviews (n = 27) with HIV + youth (15-21 years old) that had not received HIV care for at least four months. (3) Semi-structured interviews (n = 10) with educators selected from schools attended by LTFU interview participants. Transcripts were coded and analyzed employing grounded theory. RESULTS: HIV-related stigma was the overarching factor that led to LTFU among HIV + youth. Stigma operated on multiple levels to influence LTFU, including in the home/family, at school, and at the clinic. In all three settings, participants' fear of stigma due to disclosure of their HIV status contributed to LTFU. Likewise, in the three settings, the dependent relationships between youth and the key adult figures in their lives were also adversely impacted by stigma and resultant lack of disclosure. Thus, at all three settings stigma influenced fear of disclosure, which in turn impacted negatively on dependent relationships with adults on whom they rely (i.e. parents, teachers and clinicians) leading to LTFU. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions focusing on reduction of stigma, increasing safe disclosure of HIV status, and improved dependent relationships may improve retention in care of YLWH.</td>

      <td>Durability of antiretroviral therapy and predictors of virologic failure among perinatally HIV-infected children in Tanzania: a four-year follow-up.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In Tanzania, HIV-1 RNA testing is rarely available and not standard of care. Determining virologic failure is challenging and resistance mutations accumulate, thereby compromising second-line therapy. We evaluated durability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and predictors of virologic failure among a pediatric cohort at four-year follow-up. METHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional study with retrospective chart review evaluating a perinatally HIV-infected Tanzanian cohort enrolled in 2008-09 with repeat HIV-1 RNA in 2012-13. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted from charts, resistance mutations from 2008-9 were analyzed, and prospective HIV RNA was obtained. RESULTS: 161 (78%) participants of the original cohort consented to repeat HIV RNA. The average age was 12.2 years (55% adolescents >/=12 years). Average time on ART was 6.4 years with 41% receiving second-line (protease inhibitor based) therapy. Among those originally suppressed on a first-line (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase based regimen) 76% remained suppressed. Of those originally failing first-line, 88% were switched to second-line and 72% have suppressed virus. Increased level of viremia and duration of ART trended with an increased number of thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs). Increased TAMs increased the odds of virologic failure (p = 0.18), as did adolescent age (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: After viral load testing in 2008-09 many participants switched to second-line therapy. The majority achieved virologic suppression despite multiple resistance mutations. Though virologic testing would likely hasten the switch to second-line among those failing, methods to improve adherence is critical to maximize durability of ART and improve virologic outcomes among youth in resource-limited settings.</td>

      <td>A systematic review of individual and contextual factors affecting ART initiation, adherence, and retention for HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Despite progress reducing maternal mortality, HIV-related maternal deaths remain high, accounting, for example, for up to 24 percent of all pregnancy-related deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is effective in improving outcomes among HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women, yet rates of initiation, adherence, and retention remain low. This systematic literature review synthesized evidence about individual and contextual factors affecting ART use among HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women. METHODS: Searches were conducted for studies addressing the population (HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women), intervention (ART), and outcomes of interest (initiation, adherence, and retention). Quantitative and qualitative studies published in English since January 2008 were included. Individual and contextual enablers and barriers to ART use were extracted and organized thematically within a framework of individual, interpersonal, community, and structural categories. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies were included in the review. Individual-level factors included both those within and outside a woman's awareness and control (e.g., commitment to child's health or age). Individual-level barriers included poor understanding of HIV, ART, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and difficulty managing practical demands of ART. At an interpersonal level, disclosure to a spouse and spousal involvement in treatment were associated with improved initiation, adherence, and retention. Fear of negative consequences was a barrier to disclosure. At a community level, stigma was a major barrier. Key structural barriers and enablers were related to health system use and engagement, including access to services and health worker attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: To be successful, programs seeking to expand access to and continued use of ART by integrating maternal health and HIV services must identify and address the relevant barriers and enablers in their own context that are described in this review. Further research on this population, including those who drop out of or never access health services, is needed to inform effective implementation.</td>

      <td>The relation between efavirenz versus nevirapine and virologic failure in Johannesburg, South Africa.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Previous research has raised concerns that patients given nevirapine (NVP)-based regimens experience more virologic failure than patients given efavirenz (EFV)-based regimens. We investigated this hypothesis in a cohort of HIV-positive patients at a large HIV treatment clinic in South Africa. METHODS: All antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive non-pregnant patients, >/= 18 years old, without tuberculosis, who initiated treatment with either NVP or EFV from April 2004 to August 2011 at the Themba Lethu Clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa, were included. Log-binomial regression and modified Poisson regression were used to estimate risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for predictors of virologic failure, virologic suppression, and loss to follow-up (LTF), whereas a Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the risk of death, all within one year. RESULTS: Of 12,840 included patients, 62.0% were female and the median baseline CD4 count was 98 cells/mm(3) (36-169). Of these patients, 93.2% initiated an EFV-based regimen. After adjusting for baseline characteristics, no difference in death (adjusted Hazards Ratio (aHR): 0.92; 95% CI: 0.68-1.25), LTF (adjusted Risk Ratio (aRR): 1.00; 95% CI: 0.79-1.25), nor suppression (aRR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.95-1.00) at one year was found between regimens. Among patients with >/= 1 viral load >/= 4 months after ART initiation, 4% (n=350) experienced virologic failure within 12 months of initiation. Patients initiating NVP-based regimens were 60% more likely to fail than patients initiating EFV-based regimens (aRR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.13-2.22). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, patients initiating NVP-based regimens experienced more virologic failure than patients initiating EFV-based regimens. Future guidelines should consider the implications of different efficacy profiles when making recommendations for which drugs to prioritize.</td>

      <td>Strategies of testing for syphilis during pregnancy.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Each year about two million pregnant women are infected with preventable syphilis infection, mostly in developing countries. Despite the expansion of antenatal syphilis screening programmes over the past few decades, syphilis continues to be a major public health concern in developing countries. Point-of-care syphilis testing may be a useful strategy to substantially prevent syphilis-associated perinatal mortality and other negative consequences in resource-poor settings. However, the evidence on effectiveness has been generated mostly from observational study designs or has been reported as a mixed-intervention effect. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of antenatal syphilis screening in improving the uptake of screening tests and treatment, and reducing perinatal mortality. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2014) and the reference lists of retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised (individual and cluster) controlled trials comparing different screening tests conducted during routine antenatal check-ups versus no screening test. Cross-over trials and quasi-randomised experimental study designs were not eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked for accuracy. MAIN RESULTS: We included two cluster-randomised controlled trials (three reports). Both trials assessed point-of-care syphilis testing with conventional testing methods and together involved a total of 8493 pregnant women. Data from these trials were not amenable to meta-analysis as the measure of effectiveness was assessed in a non-comparable way.One trial randomised 14 antenatal clinics (including 7700 pregnant women) and was carried out at in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. The trial assessed one-stop syphilis testing using a rapid treponemal test, and was judged to have unclear methods of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, selective reporting, and other bias and low risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. Blinding was not reported and was assessed as high risk. The point-of-care testing provided screening, test results and treatment within the same day. The trial appears to have adjusted their results to account for clustering. We entered the data into RevMan using the generic inverse variance method. The incidence of congenital syphilis was lower in the clusters receiving on-site screening (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.71) and the proportion of women tested for syphilis was higher in the clusters receiving on-site screening at both the first antenatal visit and at the third trimester visit (OR 989.80, 95% CI 16.27 to 60233.05; OR 617.88, 95% CI 13.44 to 28399.01). Adequate treatment and partner treatment was higher with the on-site screening (AOR 10.44, 95% CI 1.00 to 108.99; AOR 18.17, 95% CI 3.23 to 101.20) and more syphilis cases were detected at first and third trimester visits with the on-site screening (AOR 2.45, 95% CI 1.44 to 4.18; AOR 6.27, 95% CI 1.47 to 26.69). Perinatal mortality, incidence of HIV/AIDS, obstacles in uptake of screening, any other adverse effects, or healthcare resource usage were not reported in this trial.The second trial divided clinics into seven matched pairs (including 7618 pregnant women, although results were only presented for the positive cases (793 women)), and within each pair one clinic was randomised to receive the on-site screening and the other to continue routine laboratory testing. The trial was conducted in primary healthcare clinics in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Random sequence generation were judged to be at low risk of bias, but allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data were judged to be high risk. Other bias and selective reporting bias remain unclear. Blinding was not reported and was assessed as high risk of bias. This trial assessed the primary outcome of this review (perinatal mortality) and the secondary outcomes (adverse outcomes; adequate treatment; syphilis prevalence) in the subset of women (793 women) who tested positive for syphilis. Only one outcome, adequate treatment, was adjusted to account for cluster design. However, not enough information was provided to include this in an analysis using the generic inverse variance method. Where possible, results have therefore been presented in forest plots (perinatal mortality; adequate treatment), as if the data are from a parallel randomised controlled trial. These results should therefore be interpreted with caution.The trial reported on perinatal mortality in women with positive test results and showed that on-site screening using a rapid plasma reagin test had no clear evidence of an effect on perinatal mortality reduction (odds ratio (OR) 0.63; 95% CI 0.27 to 1.48; 18/549 (3.3%) versus 8/157 (5.1%)). After loss to follow up, 396/618 (64.1%) women with positive test results received adequate treatment (two or more doses of 2.4 mega units of benzathine penicillin) in the intervention cluster versus 120/175 (68.6%) in the control (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.17). It was not possible to include any other data on reported outcomes in forest plots (adverse outcomes; syphilis prevalence). Incidence of congenital syphilis, proportion of women test for syphilis, incidence of HIV/AIDS, obstacles in uptake of screening, partner treatment, or healthcare resource usage were not reported in this trial. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review included evidence from two cluster-randomised trials at high or unclear risk of bias for most of the 'Risk of bias' domains. Data were not combined in meta-analysis because the trials used non-comparable measures of effectiveness.Point-of-care syphilis testing showed some promising results for syphilis detection and treatment rates and for use in different settings. In Mongolia point-of-care testing was found to be effective in increasing the proportion of pregnant women tested for syphilis and treatment provided, reducing congenital syphilis, and improving access to treatment for both women and their partners. In contrast, in rural South Africa, among women with positive test results, there was no clear evidence of an effect of point-of-care syphilis testing in increasing adequate syphilis treatment rates, and reducing perinatal mortality, but point-of-care testing was found to reduce delay in seeking treatment.More trials are therefore warranted to determine the effectiveness of available testing strategies for improving syphilis-associated adverse outcomes in pregnant women and neonates, especially in high-risk regions.</td>

      <td>Poor clinical outcomes for HIV infected children on antiretroviral therapy in rural Mozambique: need for program quality improvement and community engagement.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Residents of Zambezia Province, Mozambique live from rural subsistence farming and fishing. The 2009 provincial HIV prevalence for adults 15-49 years was 12.6%, higher among women (15.3%) than men (8.9%). We reviewed clinical data to assess outcomes for HIV-infected children on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in a highly resource-limited setting. METHODS: We studied rates of 2-year mortality and loss to follow-up (LTFU) for children <15 years of age initiating cART between June 2006-July 2011 in 10 rural districts. National guidelines define LTFU as >60 days following last-scheduled medication pickup. Kaplan-Meier estimates to compute mortality assumed non-informative censoring. Cumulative LTFU incidence calculations treated death as a competing risk. RESULTS: Of 753 children, 29.0% (95% CI: 24.5, 33.2) were confirmed dead by 2 years and 39.0% (95% CI: 34.8, 42.9) were LTFU with unknown clinical outcomes. The cohort mortality rate was 8.4% (95% CI: 6.3, 10.4) after 90 days on cART and 19.2% (95% CI: 16.0, 22.3) after 365 days. Higher hemoglobin at cART initiation was associated with being alive and on cART at 2 years (alive: 9.3 g/dL vs. dead or LTFU: 8.3-8.4 g/dL, p<0.01). Cotrimoxazole use within 90 days of ART initiation was associated with improved 2-year outcomes Treatment was initiated late (WHO stage III/IV) among 48% of the children with WHO stage recorded in their records. Marked heterogeneity in outcomes by district was noted (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We found poor clinical and programmatic outcomes among children taking cART in rural Mozambique. Expanded testing, early infant diagnosis, counseling/support services, case finding, and outreach are insufficiently implemented. Our quality improvement efforts seek to better link pregnancy and HIV services, expand coverage and timeliness of infant diagnosis and treatment, and increase follow-up and adherence.</td>

      <td>Drug resistance mutations from whole blood proviral DNA among patients on antiretroviral drugs in Zimbabwe.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: There are more than 500 000 HIV-infected people on antiretroviral treatment (ART) in Zimbabwe with very limited laboratory monitoring. To ensure effective treatment and prevent transmission of drug resistance, affordable treatment monitoring is needed to guide individual treatment. METHODS: 125 whole blood samples from patients on first-line ART were investigated for drug resistance mutations using an in-house genotypic testing method. Patients had been on HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors only, with some having been on both HIV and TB treatment. DNA was extracted from whole blood; amplicons were generated by nested PCR and sequenced. Drug resistance mutations were determined using the Stanford HIV drug resistance database. Exact statistics were used to investigate relationships between drug resistance and predisposing factors. RESULTS: From 125 samples, 108 were successfully analyzed for drug resistance mutations. 11 of the 108 sequences had drug resistance mutations; predominantly M184V and Y181C. For a 100-cell increase in CD4 count, the odds of being resistant were 61% lower than those with the baseline CD4 count (p = 0.04, CI: 0.34-0.98). There was no association between concurrent HIV/TB treatment and drug resistance (p = 0.41). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Although plasma samples are recommended for genotypic testing, the cost of analyzing plasma RNA makes it less feasible in resource limited settings. Lower cost DNA drug resistance testing from whole blood samples was assessed as a treatment-monitoring tool among patients followed by CD4 and clinical monitoring only. The infrequent detection of resistance and higher CD4 is consistent with effective first-line treatment. Further investigation of proviral DNA as a tool to identify drug resistance mutations is warranted.</td>

      <td>Texting improves testing: a randomized trial of two-way SMS to increase postpartum prevention of mother-to-child transmission retention and infant HIV testing.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: Many sub-Saharan African countries report high postpartum loss to follow-up of mother-baby pairs. We aimed to determine whether interactive text messages improved rates of clinic attendance and early infant HIV testing in the Nyanza region of Kenya. DESIGN: Parallel-group, unblinded, randomized controlled trial. METHODS: HIV-positive pregnant women at least 18 years old and enrolled in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV programme were randomized to receive either text messages (SMS group, n = 195) or usual care (n = 193). Messages were developed using formative focus group research informed by constructs of the Health Belief Model. The SMS group received up to eight text messages before delivery (depending on gestational age), and six messages postpartum. Primary outcomes included maternal postpartum clinic attendance and virological infant HIV testing by 8 weeks postpartum. The primary analyses were intention-to-treat. RESULTS: Of the 388 enrolled women, 381 (98.2%) had final outcome information. In the SMS group, 38 of 194 (19.6%) women attended a maternal postpartum clinic compared to 22 of 187 (11.8%) in the control group (relative risk 1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.02-2.70). HIV testing within 8 weeks was performed in 172 of 187 (92.0%) infants in the SMS group compared to 154 of 181 (85.1%) in the control group (relative risk 1.08, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.16). CONCLUSIONS: Text messaging significantly improved maternal postpartum visit attendance, but overall return rates for these visits remained low. In contrast, high rates of early infant HIV testing were achieved in both arms, with significantly higher testing rates in the SMS compared to the control infants.</td>

      <td>Minority HIV-1 drug-resistant mutations and prevention of mother-to-child transmission: perspectives for resource-limited countries.</td>
      <td>The detection and clinical significance of HIV-1 minority drug-resistant variants is a major topic of current HIV research. Whereas much attention has been placed on the clinical impact of minority drug-resistant variants in patients initiating antiretroviral therapy, their possible influence on the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy following prevention of mother-to-child transmission strategies in resource-limited settings remains largely unexplored. This review outlines the clinical significance and detection of minority drug-resistant variants, focusing primarily on studies of minority variants in the context of prevention of mother-to-child transmission and their possible influence on current regimens, especially those available in resource-limited countries. The clinical impact of minority nevirapine-resistant variants that arise in the context of prevention of mother-to-child transmission, for example, is an important factor to consider when these women initiate antiretroviral therapy that may include nevirapine or efavirenz. Minority nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant variants have been associated with treatment failure in women exposed to single-dose nevirapine. In countries like South Africa, with its longstanding use of single-dose nevirapine, this question is relevant as it is for other resource-limited countries where single-dose nevirapine is used. In the same context, various other minority drug-resistant variants (e.g. Y181C, K65R and thymidine analogue mutations etc.) are discussed. The field of next generation sequencing is very dynamic, with rapid improvements on present technologies and the introduction of novel technologies as discussed in this review. As the impact of minority drug-resistant variants in the setting of prevention of mother-to-child transmission becomes more evident, guidelines for this, especially in resource-limited countries, will need revision in order to optimize the clinical benefit from future antiretroviral therapy.</td>

      <td>Cost-effectiveness of HIV drug resistance testing to inform switching to second line antiretroviral therapy in low income settings.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: To guide future need for cheap resistance tests for use in low income settings, we assessed cost-effectiveness of drug resistance testing as part of monitoring of people on first line ART - with switching from first to second line ART being conditional on NNRTI drug resistance mutations being identified. METHODS: An individual level simulation model of HIV transmission, progression and the effect of ART which accounts for adherence and resistance development was used to compare outcomes of various potential monitoring strategies in a typical low income setting in sub-Saharan Africa. Underlying monitoring strategies considered were based on clinical disease, CD4 count or viral load. Within each we considered a strategy in which no further measures are performed, one with a viral load measure to confirm failure, and one with both a viral load measure and a resistance test. Predicted outcomes were assessed over 2015-2025 in terms of viral suppression, first line failure, switching to second line regimen, death, HIV incidence, disability-adjusted-life-years averted and costs. Potential future low costs of resistance tests ($30) were used. RESULTS: The most effective strategy, in terms of DALYs averted, was one using viral load monitoring without confirmation. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for this strategy was $2113 (the same as that for viral load monitoring with confirmation). ART monitoring strategies which involved resistance testing did not emerge as being more effective or cost effective than strategies not using it. The slightly reduced ART costs resulting from use of resistance testing, due to less use of second line regimens, was of similar magnitude to the costs of resistance tests. CONCLUSION: Use of resistance testing at the time of first line failure as part of the decision whether to switch to second line therapy was not cost-effective, even though the test was assumed to be very inexpensive.</td>

      <td>Improving validity of informed consent for biomedical research in Zambia using a laboratory exposure intervention.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Complex biomedical research can lead to disquiet in communities with limited exposure to scientific discussions, leading to rumours or to high drop-out rates. We set out to test an intervention designed to address apprehensions commonly encountered in a community where literacy is uncommon, and where complex biomedical research has been conducted for over a decade. We aimed to determine if it could improve the validity of consent. METHODS: Data were collected using focus group discussions, key informant interviews and observations. We designed an intervention that exposed participants to a detailed demonstration of laboratory processes. Each group was interviewed twice in a day, before and after exposure to the intervention in order to assess changes in their views. RESULTS: Factors that motivated people to participate in invasive biomedical research included a desire to stay healthy because of the screening during the recruitment process, regular advice from doctors, free medical services, and trust in the researchers. Inhibiting factors were limited knowledge about samples taken from their bodies during endoscopic procedures, the impact of endoscopy on the function of internal organs, and concerns about the use of biomedical samples. The belief that blood can be used for Satanic practices also created insecurities about drawing of blood samples. Further inhibiting factors included a fear of being labelled as HIV positive if known to consult heath workers repeatedly, and gender inequality. Concerns about the use and storage of blood and tissue samples were overcome by a laboratory exposure intervention. CONCLUSION: Selecting a group of members from target community and engaging them in a laboratory exposure intervention could be a useful tool for enhancing specific aspects of consent for biomedical research. Further work is needed to determine the extent to which improved understanding permeates beyond the immediate group participating in the intervention.</td>

      <td>Impact of systematic HIV testing on case finding and retention in care at a primary care clinic in South Africa.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: Systematic, opt-out HIV counselling and testing (HCT) may diagnose individuals at lower levels of immunodeficiency but may impact loss to follow-up (LTFU) if healthier people are less motivated to engage and remain in HIV care. We explored LTFU and patient clinical outcomes under two different HIV testing strategies. METHODS: We compared patient characteristics and retention in care between adults newly diagnosed with HIV by either voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) plus targeted provider-initiated counselling and testing (PITC) or systematic HCT at a primary care clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa. RESULTS: One thousand one hundred and forty-four adults were newly diagnosed by VCT/PITC and 1124 by systematic HCT. Two-thirds of diagnoses were in women. Median CD4 count at HIV diagnosis (251 vs. 264 cells/mul, P = 0.19) and proportion of individuals eligible for antiretroviral therapy (ART) (67.2% vs. 66.7%, P = 0.80) did not differ by HCT strategy. Within 1 year of HIV diagnosis, half were LTFU: 50.5% under VCT/PITC and 49.6% under systematic HCT (P = 0.64). The overall hazard of LTFU was not affected by testing policy (aHR 0.98, 95%CI: 0.87-1.10). Independent of HCT strategy, males, younger adults and those ineligible for ART were at higher risk of LTFU. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of systematic HCT did not increase baseline CD4 count. Overall retention in the first year after HIV diagnosis was low (37.9%), especially among those ineligible for ART, but did not differ by testing strategy. Expansion of HIV testing should coincide with effective strategies to increase retention in care, especially among those not yet eligible for ART at initial diagnosis.</td>

      <td>Retention and risk factors for attrition among adults in antiretroviral treatment programmes in Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: We assessed retention and predictors of attrition (recorded death or loss to follow-up) in antiretroviral treatment (ART) clinics in Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among adults (>/=18 years) starting ART during 2003-2010. We purposefully selected six health facilities per country and randomly selected 250 patients from each facility. Patients who visited clinics at least once during the 90 days before data abstraction were defined as retained. Data on individual and programme level risk factors for attrition were obtained through chart review and clinic manager interviews. Kaplan-Meier curves for retention across sites were created. Predictors of attrition were assessed using a multivariable Cox-proportional hazards model, adjusted for site-level clustering. RESULTS: From 17 facilities, 4147 patients were included. Retention ranged from 52.0% to 96.2% at 1 year to 25.8%-90.4% at 4 years. Multivariable analysis of ART initiation characteristics found the following independent risk factors for attrition: younger age [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 1.30 (1.14-1.47)], WHO stage 4 ([aHR (95% CI): 1.56 (1.29-1.88)], >10% bodyweight loss [aHR (95%CI) = 1.17 (1.00-1.38)], poor functional status [ambulatory aHR (95%CI) = 1.29 (1.09-1.54); bedridden aHR1.54 (1.15-2.07)], and increasing years of clinic operation prior to ART initiation in government facilities [aHR (95%CI) = 1.17 (1.10-1.23)]. Patients with higher CD4 cell count were less likely to experience attrition [aHR (95%CI) = 0.88 (0.78-1.00)] for every log (tenfold) increase. Sites offering community ART dispensing [aHR (95%CI) = 0.55 (0.30-1.01) for women; 0.40 (0.21-0.75) for men] had significantly less attrition. CONCLUSIONS: Patient retention to an individual programme worsened over time especially among males, younger persons and those with poor clinical indicators. Community ART drug dispensing programmes could improve retention.</td>

      <td>Assessing adherence to the 2010 antiretroviral guidelines at the antiretroviral rollout clinic in 1 military hospital, South Africa: a retrospective, cross sectional study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: HIV research is a therapeutic area for which well-defined population-specific treatment and prophylaxis guidelines exist. However, there are limited objective, evidence-based data for assessing adherence to these guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a retrospective, cross sectional study of adult HIV-infected patients receiving treatment at the antiretroviral (ARV) roll-out clinic of the Infectious Diseases Clinic Pharmacy at 1 Military Hospital (1MH) over a period of 3 years to assess clinicians' adherence to the 2010 ARV guidelines. METHODS: Pharmacy files from the pool of adult patients receiving treatment at the ARV roll-out clinic between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2012 were selected. Variables used to establish adherence were assessed through evaluation of pharmacy scripts and laboratory tests. RESULTS: In accordance with the ARV guidelines, we found a switch in the first-line regimen from stavudine to tenofovir in the period following implementation. There was no difference in baseline blood tests conducted, suggesting that clinicians were recommending a standardised test panel. Notably, similar blood tests were routinely done during follow-up visits, despite no indication for doing so. While the number of blood tests was found to decrease over time, the type of blood tests requested for specific treatment regimens was not in accordance with ARV guidelines. CONCLUSION: We used an evidence-based approach to critically assess variations from the delineated ARV guidelines. Adherence to clinical guidelines at 1MH, while demonstrating improvement in patient outcomes, highlighted the need for increased vigilance in monitoring failure of prescribers to comply with ARV guidelines.</td>

      <td>Mortality in patients with HIV-1 infection starting antiretroviral therapy in South Africa, Europe, or North America: a collaborative analysis of prospective studies.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: High early mortality in patients with HIV-1 starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa, compared to Europe and North America, is well documented. Longer-term comparisons between settings have been limited by poor ascertainment of mortality in high burden African settings. This study aimed to compare mortality up to four years on ART between South Africa, Europe, and North America. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data from four South African cohorts in which patients lost to follow-up (LTF) could be linked to the national population register to determine vital status were combined with data from Europe and North America. Cumulative mortality, crude and adjusted (for characteristics at ART initiation) mortality rate ratios (relative to South Africa), and predicted mortality rates were described by region at 0-3, 3-6, 6-12, 12-24, and 24-48 months on ART for the period 2001-2010. Of the adults included (30,467 [South Africa], 29,727 [Europe], and 7,160 [North America]), 20,306 (67%), 9,961 (34%), and 824 (12%) were women. Patients began treatment with markedly more advanced disease in South Africa (median CD4 count 102, 213, and 172 cells/microl in South Africa, Europe, and North America, respectively). High early mortality after starting ART in South Africa occurred mainly in patients starting ART with CD4 count <50 cells/microl. Cumulative mortality at 4 years was 16.6%, 4.7%, and 15.3% in South Africa, Europe, and North America, respectively. Mortality was initially much lower in Europe and North America than South Africa, but the differences were reduced or reversed (North America) at longer durations on ART (adjusted rate ratios 0.46, 95% CI 0.37-0.58, and 1.62, 95% CI 1.27-2.05 between 24 and 48 months on ART comparing Europe and North America to South Africa). While bias due to under-ascertainment of mortality was minimised through death registry linkage, residual bias could still be present due to differing approaches to and frequency of linkage. CONCLUSIONS: After accounting for under-ascertainment of mortality, with increasing duration on ART, the mortality rate on HIV treatment in South Africa declines to levels comparable to or below those described in participating North American cohorts, while substantially narrowing the differential with the European cohorts.

      <td>Molecular detection and characterization of resistant genes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex from DNA isolated from tuberculosis patients in the Eastern Cape province South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) in both animals and humans is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) primarily transmitted by inhalation of aerosolized droplets containing the organism. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) and extensive drug resistance (XDR) are evolutionary features of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to subvert the antibiotic regimes in place. The heavy burden of TB worsened by HIV endemic in South Africa motivated for the investigation of MTBC prevalence among TB patients in Port Elizabeth and the amplification and sequencing of the DNA amplicons known to confer resistance to TB drugs. METHODS: Three thousand eight hundred and ten (3810) sputum specimens were processed and DNA was isolated from sputum specimens collected from different hospitals and health care places in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. DNA was amplified using the Seeplex(R) MTB Nested ACE detection assay. The agar-dilution proportion method was used to perform drug-sensitivity testing using 7H10 Middlebrook medium. Target genes known to confer resistance to first and second-line drugs were amplified and the amplicons sequenced. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety (5%) DNA samples tested positive for MTBC and from the resistant profiles of the 190 positive samples, we noted that multidrug-resistant TB was identified in 189 (99.5%) with 190 (100%) patients infected with MTB resistant to isoniazid and 189 (99.5%) having MTB resistant to rifampicin. Other percentages of drug resistance observed including 40% pre-XDR and 60% of XDR. CONCLUSION: This study provides valuable data on the different kinds of mutations occurring at various target loci in resistant MTBC strains isolated from samples obtained from the Eastern Cape Province. The results obtained reveal a high incidence of MDR amongst the positive samples from Eastern Cape Province, South Africa.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: Retention of HAART-eligible HIV-infected patients in clinical follow-up systems are now becoming an important issue in sub-Saharan African countries. METHODS: In this retrospective study (April 2008 to November 2011), we assessed the attrition rate variations in a cohort of 509 HAART-eligible patients in Chad. RESULTS: Decrease in levels of loss to follow-up were observed during the implementation of continuous free access to HAART (72.5 vs 10%; p<0.001) and was independent of gender, age, WHO clinical stage and CD4+ T cell count at inclusion and of the time delay to initiate HAART (p>0.48). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the implementation of free access to HAART without any interruption of supply, from autumn 2009, could be the factor that potentially changed the HIV patient attrition rate in this resource-limited setting.</td>

      <td>Limited utility of dried-blood- and plasma spot-based screening for antiretroviral treatment failure with Cobas Ampliprep/TaqMan HIV-1 version 2.0.</td>
      <td>The 2013 WHO antiretroviral therapy (ART) guidelines recommend dried blood spots (DBS) as an alternative specimen type for viral load (VL) monitoring. We assessed the programmatic utility of screening for antiretroviral (ARV) treatment failure (TF) at 5,000 and 1,000 copies/ml using DBS and dried plasma spots (DPS) with a commonly used VL assay, the Roche Cobas Ampliprep/Cobas TaqMan V.2.0 (CAP/CTM). Plasma, DBS, and DPS were prepared from 839 whole-blood specimens collected from patients on ART for >/= 6 months at three public facilities in Namibia. Using the CAP/CTM test, VL were measured in plasma, DBS, and DPS, and the results were compared using the plasma VL as the reference standard. The clinical sensitivities, specificities, and positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of DBS at ARV TF diagnostic thresholds of 5,000 copies/ml and 1,000 copies/ml were 0.99, 0.55, 0.33, and 0.99 and 0.99, 0.26, 0.29, and 0.99, respectively, and for DPS at TF diagnostic thresholds of 5,000 copies/ml and 1,000 copies/ml, they were 0.88, 0.98, 0.92, and 0.97 and 0.91, 0.96, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively. The prevalences of TF were overestimated in DBS by 33% and 57% at these two thresholds, respectively. A high rate of false-positive results would occur if the CAP/CTM with DBS were to be used to screen for ARV TF. WHO recommendations for DBS-based VL monitoring should be specific to the VL assay version and type. Despite the better performance of DPS, the programmatic utility for TF screening may be limited by requirements for processing the whole blood at the collection site.</td>

      <td>Oligonucleotide ligation assay detects HIV drug resistance associated with virologic failure among antiretroviral-naive adults in Kenya.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is increasing in some areas of Africa. Detection of TDR may predict virologic failure of first-line nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART). We evaluated the utility of a relatively inexpensive oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA) to detect clinically relevant TDR at the time of ART initiation. METHODS: Pre-ART plasmas from ART-naive Kenyans initiating an NNRTI-based fixed-dose combination ART in a randomized adherence trial conducted in 2006 were retrospectively analyzed by OLA for mutations conferring resistance to NNRTI (K103N, Y181C, and G190A) and lamivudine (M184V). Post-ART plasmas were analyzed for virologic failure (>/=1000 copies/mL) at 6-month intervals over 18-month follow-up. Pre-ART plasmas of those with virologic failure were evaluated for drug resistance by consensus and 454-pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Among 386 participants, TDR was detected by OLA in 3.89% (95% confidence interval: 2.19 to 6.33) and was associated with a 10-fold higher rate of virologic failure (hazard ratio: 10.39; 95% confidence interval: 3.23 to 32.41; P < 0.001) compared with those without TDR. OLA detected 24 TDR mutations (K103N: n = 13; Y181C: n = 5; G190A: n = 3; M184V: n = 3) in 15 subjects (NNRTI: n = 15; 3TC: n = 3). Among 51 participants who developed virologic failure, consensus sequencing did not detect additional TDR mutations conferring high-level resistance, and pyrosequencing only detected additional mutations at frequencies <2%. Mutant frequencies <2% at ART initiation were significantly less likely to be found at the time of virologic failure compared with frequencies >/=2% (22% vs. 63%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Detection of TDR by a point mutation assay may prevent the use of suboptimal ART.</td>

      <td>CD4 trajectory adjusting for dropout among HIV-positive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy in an East African HIV care centre.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: Estimates of CD4 response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) obtained by averaging data from patients in care, overestimate population CD4 response and treatment program effectiveness because they do not consider data from patients who are deceased or not in care. We use mathematical methods to assess and adjust for this bias based on patient characteristics. DESIGN: We examined data from 25,261 HIV-positive patients from the East Africa IeDEA Consortium. METHODS: We used inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) to represent patients not in care by patients in care with similar characteristics. We address two questions: What would the median CD4 be "had everyone starting ART remained on observation?" and "were everyone starting ART maintained on treatment?" RESULTS: Routine CD4 count estimates were higher than adjusted estimates even under the best-case scenario of maintaining all patients on treatment. Two years after starting ART, differences between estimates diverged from 30 cells/microL, assuming similar mortality and treatment access among dropouts as patients in care, to over 100 cells/microL assuming 20% lower survival and 50% lower treatment access among dropouts. When considering only patients in care, the proportion of patients with CD4 above 350 cells/microL was 50% adjusted to below 30% when accounting for patients not in care. One-year mortality diverged 6-14% from the naive estimates depending on assumptions about access to care among lost patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ignoring mortality and loss to care results in over-estimation of ART response for patients starting treatment and exaggerates the efficacy of treatment programs administering it.</td>

      <td>Evaluation of treatment outcomes for patients on first-line regimens in US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) clinics in Uganda: predictors of virological and immunological response from RV288 analyses.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: Viral load (VL) monitoring is recommended, but seldom performed, in resource-constrained countries. RV288 is a US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) basic programme evaluation to determine the proportion of patients on treatment who are virologically suppressed and to identify predictors of virological suppression and recovery of CD4 cell count. Analyses from Uganda are presented here. METHODS: In this cross-sectional, observational study, patients on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) (efavirenz or nevirapine+zidovudine/lamivudine) from Kayunga District Hospital and Kagulamira Health Center were randomly selected for a study visit that included determination of viral load (HIV-1 RNA), CD4 cell count and clinical chemistry tests. Subjects were recruited by time on treatment: 6-12, 13-24 or >24 months. Logistic regression modelling identified predictors of virological suppression. Linear regression modelling identified predictors of CD4 cell count recovery on ART. RESULTS: We found that 85.2% of 325 subjects were virologically suppressed (viral load<47 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml). There was no difference in the proportion of virologically suppressed subjects by time on treatment, yet CD4 counts were higher in each successive stratum. Women had higher median CD4 counts than men overall (406 vs. 294 cells/muL, respectively; P<0.0001) and in each time-on-treatment stratum. In a multivariate logistic regression model, predictors of virological suppression included efavirenz use [odds ratio (OR) 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22-1.02; P=0.057], lower cost of clinic visits (OR 0.815; 95% CI 0.66-1.00; P=0.05), improvement in CD4 percentage (OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.014-1.107; P=0.009), and care at Kayunga vs. Kangulamira (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.23-0.92; P=0.035). In a multivariate linear regression model of covariates associated with CD4 count recovery, time on highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) (P<0.0001), patient satisfaction with care (P=0.038), improvements in total lymphocyte count (P<0.0001) and haemoglobin concentration (P=0.05) were positively associated, whereas age at start of ART (P=0.0045) was negatively associated with this outcome. CONCLUSIONS: High virological suppression rates are achievable on first-line ART in Uganda. The odds of virological suppression were positively associated with efavirenz use and improvements in CD4 cell percentage and total lymphocyte count and negatively associated with the cost of travel to the clinic. CD4 cell reconstitution was positively associated with CD4 count at study visit, time on ART, satisfaction with care at clinic, haemoglobin concentration and total lymphocyte count and negatively associated with age.</td>

      <td>Poor performance of the determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab combo fourth-generation rapid test for detection of acute infections in a National Household Survey in Swaziland.</td>
      <td>Fourth-generation HIV rapid tests (RTs) claim to detect both p24 antigen (Ag) and HIV antibodies (Ab) for early identification of acute infections, important for targeting prevention and reducing HIV transmission. In a nationally representative household survey in Swaziland, 18,172 adults, age 18 to 49 years, received home-based HIV rapid testing in 2010 and 2011. Of the 18,172 individuals, 5,822 (32.0%) were Ab positive (Ab(+)) by the Determine HIV-1/2 Ab/Ab combo test, and 5,789 (99.4%) of those were confirmed to be reactive in the Uni-Gold test. Determine combo identified 12 individuals as having acute infections (Ag(+)/Ab negative [Ab(-)]); however, none had detectable HIV-1 RNA and 8 of 12 remained HIV negative at their 6-week follow-up visit (4 were lost to follow-up). All RT-nonreactive samples were pooled and tested by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) to identify acute infections. NAAT identified 13 (0.1%) of the 12,338 HIV antibody-negative specimens as HIV RNA positive, with RNA levels ranging from 300 to >10,000,000 copies/ml. However, none of them were Ag(+) by Determine combo. Follow-up testing of 12 of the 13 NAAT-positive individuals at 6 months demonstrated 12 seroconversions (1 individual was lost to follow-up). Therefore, the Determine combo test had a sensitivity of 0% (95% confidence interval, 0 to 28) and positive predictive value of 0% for the detection of acute infections. The ability of the 4th-generation Determine combo to detect antigen was very poor in Swaziland. Thus, the Determine combo test does not add any value to the current testing algorithm; rather, it adds additional costs and complexity to HIV diagnosis. The detection of acute HIV infections may need to rely on other testing strategies.</td>

      <td>Preventing tuberculosis among HIV-infected pregnant women in Lesotho: the case for rolling out active case finding and isoniazid preventive therapy.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The Lesotho Ministry of Health issued guidelines on active case finding (ACF) for tuberculosis (TB) and isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) in April 2011. ACF has been recommended in maternal and child health (MCH) settings globally, however, the feasibility of implementing IPT within MCH in countries with high concurrent HIV and TB epidemics is unknown. DESIGN/METHODS: The study evaluated the implementation of ACF and IPT guidelines in MCH settings in 2 health facilities in Lesotho. This descriptive prospective study analyzed data collected during routine services. Categorical data and continuous variables were summarized using descriptive statistics. The chi test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to ascertain significant associations between categorical and continuous variables, respectively. RESULTS: Data from 160 HIV-positive and 640 HIV-negative women were reviewed. Within this study population, 99.8% of women were screened for TB, and 11.4% HIV-positive women compared with 2.3% HIV-negative women were reported to have symptoms of TB (P < 0.001). IPT was initiated in 124/158 (78.5%) HIV-positive pregnant women, 64.5% women completed a 6-month IPT regimen, 2 (1.6%) died of causes unrelated to IPT/TB, and 31.5% were lost to follow-up. Predictors of IPT initiation among HIV-positive women included gestational age at the first antenatal visit (unadjusted odds ratio, -0.93; 95% confidence interval: -0.88 to 0.98), and receipt of antiretroviral therapy for treatment rather than for prevention of mother-to-child transmission prophylaxis only (odds ratio, 4.59; 95% confidence interval: 1.32 to 15.93). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of ACF and IPT is feasible within the MCH setting. Uptake of IPT during pregnancy among HIV-positive women was high, but with a high rate of loss to follow-up.</td>

      <td>Observational research on NCDs in HIV-positive populations: conceptual and methodological considerations.</td>
      <td>Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) account for a growing burden of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy interact with NCD risk factors in complex ways, and research into this "web of causation" has so far been largely based on data from high-income countries. However, improving the understanding, treatment, and prevention of NCDs in LMICs requires region-specific evidence. Priority research areas include: (1) defining the burden of NCDs among people living with HIV, (2) understanding the impact of modifiable risk factors, (3) evaluating effective and efficient care strategies at individual and health systems levels, and (4) evaluating cost-effective prevention strategies. Meeting these needs will require observational data, both to inform the design of randomized trials and to replace trials that would be unethical or infeasible. Focusing on Sub-Saharan Africa, we discuss data resources currently available to inform this effort and consider key limitations and methodological challenges. Existing data resources often lack population-based samples; HIV-negative, HIV-positive, and antiretroviral therapy-naive comparison groups; and measurements of key NCD risk factors and outcomes. Other challenges include loss to follow-up, competing risk of death, incomplete outcome ascertainment and measurement of factors affecting clinical decision making, and the need to control for (time-dependent) confounding. We review these challenges and discuss strategies for overcoming them through augmented data collection and appropriate analysis. We conclude with recommendations to improve the quality of data and analyses available to inform the response to HIV and NCD comorbidity in LMICs.</td>

      <td>Outcomes of the Botswana national HIV/AIDS treatment programme from 2002 to 2010: a longitudinal analysis.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Short-term mortality rates among patients with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa are higher than those recorded in high-income countries, but systematic long-term comparisons have not been made because of the scarcity of available data. We analysed the effect of the implementation of Botswana's national ART programme, known as Masa, from 2002 to 2010. METHODS: The Masa programme started on Jan 21, 2002. Patients who were eligible for ART according to national guidelines had their data collected prospectively through a clinical information system developed by the Botswana Ministry of Health. A dataset of all available electronic records for adults (>/=18 years) who had enrolled by April 30, 2010, was extracted and sent to the study team. All data were anonymised before analysis. The primary outcome was mortality. To assess the effect of loss to follow-up, we did a series of sensitivity analyses assuming varying proportions of the population lost to follow-up to be dead. FINDINGS: We analysed the records of 126,263 patients, of whom 102,713 had documented initiation of ART. Median follow-up time was 35 months (IQR 14-56), with a median of eight follow-up visits (4-14). 15,270 patients were deemed lost to follow-up by the end of the study. 63% (78,866) of the study population were women; median age at baseline was 34 years for women (IQR 29-41) and 38 years for men (33-45). 10,230 (8%) deaths were documented during the 9 years of the study. Mortality was highest during the first 3 months after treatment initiation at 12.8 deaths per 100 person-years (95% CI 12.4-13.2), but decreased to 1.16 deaths per 100 person-years (1.12-1.2) in the second year of treatment, and to 0.15 deaths per 100 person-years (0.09-0.25) over the next 7 years of follow-up. In each calendar year after the start of the Masa programme in 2002, average CD4 cell counts at enrolment increased (from 101 cells/muL [IQR 44-156] in 2002, to 191 cells/muL [115-239] in 2010). In each year, the proportion of the total enrolled population who died in that year decreased, from 63% (88 of 140) in 2002, to 0.8% (13 of 1599) in 2010. A sensitivity analysis assuming that 60% of the population lost to follow-up had died gave 3000 additional deaths, increasing overall mortality from 8% to 11-13%. INTERPRETATION: The Botswana national HIV/AIDS treatment programme reduced mortality among adults with HIV to levels much the same as in other low-income or middle-income countries.

      <td>Abbreviated HIV counselling and testing and enhanced referral to care in Uganda: a factorial randomised controlled trial.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: HIV counselling and testing and linkage to care are crucial for successful HIV prevention and treatment. Abbreviated counselling could save time; however, its effect on HIV risk is uncertain and methods to improve linkage to care have not been studied. METHODS: We did this factorial randomised controlled study at Mulago Hospital, Uganda. Participants were randomly assigned to abbreviated or traditional HIV counselling and testing; HIV-infected patients were randomly assigned to enhanced linkage to care or standard linkage to care. All study personnel except counsellors and the data officer were masked to study group assignment. Participants had structured interviews, given once every 3 months. We compared sexual risk behaviour by counselling strategy with a 6.5% non-inferiority margin. We used Cox proportional hazards analyses to compare HIV outcomes by linkage to care over 1 year and tested for interaction by sex. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00648232). FINDINGS: We enrolled 3415 participants; 1707 assigned to abbreviated counselling versus 1708 assigned to traditional. Unprotected sex with an HIV discordant or status unknown partner was similar in each group (232/823 [27.9%] vs 251/890 [28.2%], difference -0.3%, one-sided 95% CI 3.2). Loss to follow-up was lower for traditional counselling than for abbreviated counselling (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.61, 95% CI 0.44-0.83). 1003 HIV-positive participants were assigned to enhanced linkage (n=504) or standard linkage to care (n=499). Linkage to care did not have a significant effect on mortality or receipt of co-trimoxazole. Time to treatment in men with CD4 cell counts of 250 cells per muL or fewer was lower for enhanced linkage versus standard linkage (adjusted HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41-0.87) and time to HIV care was decreased among women (0.80, 0.66-0.96). INTERPRETATION: Abbreviated HIV counselling and testing did not adversely affect risk behaviour. Linkage to care interventions might decrease time to enrolment in HIV care and antiretroviral treatment and thus might affect secondary HIV transmission and improve treatment outcomes.

      <td>Hepatitis B virus sub-genotype A1 infection is characterized by high replication levels and rapid emergence of drug resistance in HIV-positive adults receiving first-line antiretroviral therapy in Malawi.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: It has been proposed that hepatitis B virus (HBV) sub-genotype A1 infections have mild outcomes and a low risk of drug-resistance among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) receiving lamivudine-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) without tenofovir in Africa. METHODS: The virologic expression of HBV sub-genotype A1 coinfection was studied over 12 months in HIV-positive adults starting stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine in Malawi, using Sanger, deep, clonal, and single full-genome sequencing for the sensitive characterization of HBV resistance-associated mutations (RAMs). RESULTS: Among 1117 subjects, 133 (12%) tested HBsAg-positive. After starting ART, retention rates were 96/133 (72%) at 6 months and 54/133 (41%) at 12 months. Based upon the last available follow-up, 92/96 (96%) subjects achieved HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL, 48/96 (50%) showed HBV DNA <14 IU/mL, and 24/96 (25%) acquired HBV RAMs. At 6 months, M204I was detected in 8/46 (17%) and 16/17 (94%) subjects using Sanger and deep sequencing, respectively. At 12 months, all viremic patients had multiple resistance and compensatory mutations coexisting on the same HBV genomes. Comparing HBeA-positive (67/133, 50%) with HBeAg-negative subjects, 64/67 (96%) vs 35/66 (55%) showed baseline HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL (P = .0006), 39/47 (17%) vs 9/49 (82%) had persistent HBV DNA detection during follow-up (P < .0001), and 23/47 (49%) vs 2/49 (4%) acquired HBV RAMs (P < .0001). Baseline HBV DNA levels were median 8.1 vs 5.3 log10 IU/mL in subjects with vs those without treatment-emergent RAMs (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: HBV sub-genotype A1 infections showed a severe virologic expression in HIV-positive Malawians. The findings strengthen the urgency of interventions to improve ascertainment and management of chronic hepatitis B in the region.</td>

      <td>Patient loss to follow-up before antiretroviral therapy initiation in rural Mozambique.</td>
      <td>Within Mozambique's current HIV care system, there are numerous opportunities for a person to become lost to follow-up (LTFU) prior to initiating antiretroviral therapy (pre-ART). We explored pre-ART LTFU in Zambezia province utilizing quantitative and qualitative methods. Patients were deemed LTFU if they were more than 60 days late for either a scheduled appointment or a CD4+ cell count blood draw, according to national guidelines. Among 13,968 adult patients registered for care, 211 (1.8 %) died, one transferred, 2,196 (15.7 %) initiated ART, and 9,195 (65.8 %) were LTFU during the first year. Being male, younger, less educated, and/or having no home electricity were associated with LTFU. Qualitative interviews revealed that poor clinical care, logistics and competing priorities contribute to attrition. In addition, many expressed fears of stigma and/or rejection by family or community members because they were HIV-infected. At 66 %, pre-ART LTFU in Zambezia, Mozambique is a significant problem. This study highlights characteristics of lost patients and discusses barriers requiring consideration to improve retention.</td>

      <td>Hepatocellular carcinoma: clinicopathological profile and challenges of management in a resource-limited setting.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common cancers worldwide and its incidence is reported to be increasing in resource-limited countries. There is a paucity of published data regarding hepatocellular carcinoma in Tanzania, and the study area in particular. This study describes the clinicopathological profile of hepatocellular carcinoma in our local setting and highlights the challenging problems in the management of this disease. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of histopathologically confirmed cases of hepatocellular carcinoma seen at Bugando Medical Center between March 2009 and February 2013. RESULTS: A total of 142 patients (M: F = 2.2: 1) were studied representing 4.6% of all malignancies. The median age of patients was 45 years. Hepatitis B virus infection (66.2%) and heavy alcohol consumption (60.6%) were the most frequently identified risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma. The majority of patients (88.0%) presented late with advanced stages. HBsAg was positive in 66.2% of the patients and Hepatitis C Virus antibody in 16.9%. Thirteen (9.2%) patients tested positive for HIV infection. Most patients (52.8%) had both right and left lobe involvement. The trabecular pattern (47.9%) was the most frequent histopathological type. None of patients had curative therapy because of the advanced nature of the disease. Coagulopathy (45.7%) was the most common complications. The overall mortality rate was 46.5% and it was significantly associated with comorbidity, HIV positivity, CD4+ count <200 cells/mul, high histological grade, advanced stage of the tumor, presence of distant metastases at the time of diagnosis, and associated complications (P < 0.001). The overall median duration of hospital stay was 14 days. The majority of patients (71.1%) were lost to follow-up at the end of the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatocellular carcinoma patients in this region are relatively young at diagnosis and the majority of them present late with an advanced stage and high rate of distant metastasis. Lack of awareness of the disease, poor accessibility to healthcare facilities, and lack of screening programs in this region may contribute to advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. There is a need for early detection, adequate treatment, and proper follow-up to improve treatment outcome.</td>

      <td>Can male circumcision have an impact on the HIV epidemic in men who have sex with men?</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Three trials have demonstrated the prophylactic effect of male circumcision (MC) for HIV acquisition among heterosexuals, and MC interventions are underway throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Similar efforts for men who have sex with men (MSM) are stymied by the potential for circumcised MSM to acquire HIV easily through receptive sex and transmit easily through insertive sex. Existing work suggests that MC for MSM should reach its maximum potential in settings where sexual role segregation is historically high and relatively stable across the lifecourse; HIV incidence among MSM is high; reported willingness for prophylactic circumcision is high; and pre-existing circumcision rates are low. We aim to identify the likely public health impact that MC interventions among MSM would have in one setting that fulfills these conditions-Peru-as a theoretical upper bound for their effectiveness among MSM generally. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We use a dynamic, stochastic sexual network model based in exponential-family random graph modeling and parameterized from multiple behavioral surveys of Peruvian MSM. We consider three enrollment criteria (insertive during 100%, >80% or >60% of UAI) and two levels of uptake (25% and 50% of eligible men); we explore sexual role proportions from two studies and different frequencies of switching among role categories. Each scenario is simulated 10 times. We estimate that efficiency could reach one case averted per 6 circumcisions. However, the population-level impact of an optimistic MSM-MC intervention in this setting would likely be at most approximately 5-10% incidence and prevalence reductions over 25 years. CONCLUSIONS: Roll-out of MC for MSM in Peru would not result in a substantial reduction in new HIV infections, despite characteristics in this population that could maximize such effects. Additional studies are needed to confirm these results for other MSM populations, and providers may consider the individual health benefits of offering MC to their MSM patients.</td>

      <td>Characteristics and outcomes among older HIV-positive adults enrolled in HIV programs in four sub-Saharan African countries.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Limited information exists on adults >/=50 years receiving HIV care in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODOLOGY: Using routinely-collected longitudinal patient-level data among 391,111 adults >/=15 years enrolling in HIV care from January 2005-December 2010 and 184,689 initiating ART, we compared characteristics and outcomes between older (>/=50 years) and younger adults at 199 clinics in Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Tanzania. We calculated proportions over time of newly enrolled and active adults receiving HIV care and initiating ART who were >/=50 years; cumulative incidence of loss to follow-up (LTF) and recorded death one year after enrollment and ART initiation, and CD4+ response following ART initiation. FINDINGS: From 2005-2010, the percentage of adults >/=50 years newly enrolled in HIV care remained stable at 10%, while the percentage of adults >/=50 years newly initiating ART (10% [2005]-12% [2010]), active in follow-up (10% [2005]-14% (2010]), and active on ART (10% [2005]-16% [2010]) significantly increased. One year after enrollment, older patients had significantly lower incidence of LTF (33.1% vs. 32.6%[40-49 years], 40.5%[25-39 years], and 56.3%[15-24 years]; p-value<0.0001), but significantly higher incidence of recorded death (6.0% vs. 5.0% [40-49 years], 4.1% [25-39 years], and 2.8% [15-24 years]; p-valve<0.0001). LTF was lower after vs. before ART initiation for all ages, with older adults experiencing less LTF than younger adults. Among 85,763 ART patients with baseline and follow-up CD4+ counts, adjusted average 12-month CD4+ response for older adults was 20.6 cells/mm3 lower than for adults 25-39 years of age (95% CI: 17.1-24.1). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of patients who are >/=50 years has increased over time and been driven by aging of the existing patient population. Older patients experienced less LTF, higher recorded mortality and less robust CD4+ response after ART initiation. Increased programmatic attention on older adults receiving HIV care in sub-Saharan Africa is warranted.</td>

      <td>Prevalence of lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities in HIV-infected African children after 3 years on first-line antiretroviral therapy.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Most pediatric lipodystrophy data come from high-income/middle-income countries, but most HIV-infected children live in sub-Saharan Africa, where lipodystrophy studies have predominantly investigated stavudine-based regimens. METHODS: Three years after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, body circumferences and skinfold thicknesses were measured (n = 590), and fasted lipid profile assayed (n = 325), in children from 2 ARROW trial centres in Uganda/Zimbabwe. Analyses compared randomization to long-term versus short-term versus no zidovudine from ART initiation [unadjusted; latter 2 groups receiving abacavir+lamivudine+non-nucleoside-reverse-transciptase-inhibitor (nNRTI) long-term], and nonrandomized (confounder-adjusted) receipt of nevirapine versus efavirenz. RESULTS: Body circumferences and skinfold thicknesses were similar regardless of zidovudine exposure (P > 0.1), except for subscapular and supra-iliac skinfolds-for-age which were greater with long-term zidovudine (0.006 < P < 0.047). Circumferences/skinfolds were also similar with efavirenz and nevirapine (adjusted P > 0.09; 0.02 < P < 0.03 for waist/waist-hip-ratio). Total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, HDL/triglyceride-ratio (P < 0.0001) and triglycerides (P = 0.01) were lower with long-term zidovudine. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol was higher with efavirenz than nevirapine (P < 0.001). Most lipids remained within normal ranges (75% cholesterol, 85% LDL and 100% triglycerides) but more on long-term zidovudine (3 NRTI) had abnormal HDL-cholesterol (88% vs. 40% short/no-zidovudine, P < 0.0001). Only 8/579(1.4%) children had clinical fat wasting (5 grade 1; 3 grade 2); 2(0.3%) had grade 1 fat accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term zidovudine-based ART is associated with similar body circumferences and skinfold thicknesses to abacavir-based ART, with low rates of lipid abnormalities and clinical lipodystrophy, providing reassurance where national programs now recommend long-term zidovudine. Efavirenz and nevirapine were also similar; however, the higher LDL observed with efavirenz and lower HDL observed with zidovudine suggests that zidovudine+lamivudine+efavirenz should be investigated in future.</td>

      <td>Outcomes of a nurse-managed service for stable HIV-positive patients in a large South African public sector antiretroviral therapy programme.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: Models of care utilizing task shifting and decentralization are needed to support growing ART programmes. We compared patient outcomes between a doctor-managed clinic and a nurse-managed down-referral site in Cape Town, South Africa. METHODS: Analysis included all adults who initiated ART between 2002 and 2011 within a large public sector ART service. Stable patients were eligible for down-referral. Outcomes [mortality, loss to follow-up (LTFU), virologic failure] were compared under different models of care using proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates. RESULTS: Five thousand seven hundred and forty-six patients initiated ART and over 5 years 41% (n = 2341) were down-referred; the median time on ART before down-referral was 1.6 years (interquartile range, 0.9-2.6). The nurse-managed down-referral site reported lower crude rates of mortality, LTFU and virologic failure compared with the doctor-managed clinic. After adjustment, there was no difference in the risk of mortality or virologic failure by model of care. However, patients who were down-referred were more likely to be LTFU than those retained at the doctor-managed site (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.09-1.69). Increased levels of LTFU in the nurse-managed vs. doctor-managed service were observed in subgroups of male patients, those with advanced disease at initiation and those who started ART in the early years of the programme. CONCLUSION: Reorganization of ART maintenance by down-referral to nurse-managed services is associated with programme outcomes similar to those achieved using doctor-driven primary care services. Further research is necessary to identify optimal models of care to support long-term retention of patients on ART in resource-limited settings.</td>

      <td>Gender-specific risk factors for virologic failure in KwaZulu-Natal: automobile ownership and financial insecurity.</td>
      <td>We sought to examine which socioeconomic indicators are risk factors for virologic failure among HIV-1 infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. A case-control study of virologic failure was conducted among patients recruited from the outpatient clinic at McCord Hospital in Durban, South Africa between October 1, 2010 and June 30, 2012. Cases were those failing first-line ART, defined as viral load >1,000 copies/mL. Univariate logistic regression was performed on sociodemographic data for the outcome of virologic failure. Variables found significant (p < 0.05) were used in multivariate models and all models were stratified by gender. Of 158 cases and 300 controls, 35 % were male and median age was 40 years. Gender stratification of models revealed automobile ownership was a risk factor among males, while variables of financial insecurity (unemployment, non-spouse family paying for care, staying with family) were risk factors for women. In this cohort, financial insecurity among women and automobile ownership among men were risk factors for virologic failure. Risk factor differences between genders demonstrate limitations of generalized risk factor analysis.</td>

      <td>Preferential adherence to antiretroviral therapy over tuberculosis treatment: a qualitative study of drug-resistant TB/HIV co-infected patients in South Africa.</td>
      <td>Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and second-line antituberculosis medications is essential to achieve successful outcomes among individuals co-infected with HIV and multi or extensively drug-resistant TB (M/XDR-TB). In 2012-2013, we designed a qualitative study to explore barriers to adherence in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We conducted six focus groups comprising 23 adults receiving treatment for either MDR-TB (n = 2) or XDR-TB (n = 21); 17 were on concurrent ART. Participants expressed a preference for ART over M/XDR-TB treatment as a result of greater tolerability, lower pill burden and a commitment to ART. Treatment outcomes and the social morbidity associated with M/XDR-TB, characterised by public notification, stigma and social isolation, were perceived to be worse than with HIV. Poor communication, low patient involvement and provider supervision of treatment exacerbated participants' negative experiences with TB care. To improve adherence, it is critical that new regimens for drug-resistant TB be developed with better efficacy, lower pill burden and fewer adverse effects. For the first time, such improved regimens are on the horizon. In parallel and equally important is the implementation of a cohesive approach that promotes patient involvement, empowerment and treatment literacy for HIV and for TB.</td>

      <td>Cost-effectiveness of socioeconomic support as part of HIV care for the poor in an urban community-based antiretroviral program in Uganda.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic support reduced nonretention in a community-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) program in Uganda. However, resource implications of expanding socioeconomic support are large, and cost-effectiveness analysis can inform budget priorities. We compared the incremental benefits and costs of providing education, food, or both forms of support (dual support) with existing ART services from a health care provider's perspective. METHODS: Costs and outcome data were collected from a cohort of 2371 adult patients with HIV receiving education, food, or dual support from Reach Out Mbuya between 2004 and 2010. The primary outcome was averted loss to follow-up. The number of follow-up days was calculated for each patient along with accrued service and fixed program costs for the alternative forms of socioeconomic support in USD by standard costing methods. The socioeconomic support types were compared incrementally over the study period. RESULTS: After 7 years, 762 (33%) of the patients were loss to follow-up with 42% of them receiving food. In the presence of providing ART, education support was less costly and more effective than the alternatives. The average unit cost for education, food, and dual support were $237, $538, and $776, respectively. The average total annual costs were $88,643 for education, $538,005 for food, and $103,045 for dual support. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with food or dual support, investing in education of the children of ART patients is less costly and more effective in improving patient retention. Reach Out Mbuya should embrace this paradigm shift and channel its resources more efficiently and effectively by focusing on education support.</td>

      <td>Assessment of second-line antiretroviral regimens for HIV therapy in Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The efficacy and toxic effects of nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are uncertain when these agents are used with a protease inhibitor in second-line therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in resource-limited settings. Removing the NRTIs or replacing them with raltegravir may provide a benefit. METHODS: In this open-label trial in sub-Saharan Africa, we randomly assigned 1277 adults and adolescents with HIV infection and first-line treatment failure to receive a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (lopinavir-ritonavir) plus clinician-selected NRTIs (NRTI group, 426 patients), a protease inhibitor plus raltegravir in a superiority comparison (raltegravir group, 433 patients), or protease-inhibitor monotherapy after 12 weeks of induction therapy with raltegravir in a noninferiority comparison (monotherapy group, 418 patients). The primary composite end point, good HIV disease control, was defined as survival with no new World Health Organization stage 4 events, a CD4+ count of more than 250 cells per cubic millimeter, and a viral load of less than 10,000 copies per milliliter or 10,000 copies or more with no protease resistance mutations at week 96 and was analyzed with the use of imputation of data (</=4%). RESULTS: Good HIV disease control was achieved in 60% of the patients (mean, 255 patients) in the NRTI group, 64% of the patients (mean, 277) in the raltegravir group (P=0.21 for the comparison with the NRTI group; superiority of raltegravir not shown), and 55% of the patients (mean, 232) in the monotherapy group (noninferiority of monotherapy not shown, based on a 10-percentage-point margin). There was no significant difference in rates of grade 3 or 4 adverse events among the three groups (P=0.82). The viral load was less than 400 copies per milliliter in 86% of patients in the NRTI group, 86% in the raltegravir group (P=0.97), and 61% in the monotherapy group (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: When given with a protease inhibitor in second-line therapy, NRTIs retained substantial virologic activity without evidence of increased toxicity, and there was no advantage to replacing them with raltegravir. Virologic control was inferior with protease-inhibitor monotherapy.

      <td>Outcomes, feasibility and acceptability of a group support psychotherapeutic intervention for depressed HIV-affected Ugandan adults: a pilot study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Psychotherapy is the recommended first line treatment for mild to moderate depression. However, its availability in low resource settings is limited. We developed a manualized culturally sensitive group support psychotherapeutic intervention for depressed HIV affected Ugandan adults. In this study, we aimed to assess its feasibility, acceptability and impact on depression, functioning, social support and self-esteem. METHODS: A total of 77 depressed individuals were assigned to the group intervention (n=48) and a wait-list control group (n=29), and assessed before, during and at the end of the intervention. The self-reporting questionnaire, a locally relevant function assessment instrument, the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, and the multiple dimensions perceived social support scale were administered to assess depression symptoms, functioning, self-esteem and social support at three assessment periods. Multivariate longitudinal regression models were used to determine change in outcomes over time between the two groups. Participants were asked to evaluate the intervention. RESULTS: Post -intervention assessments indicate that, in comparison to the wait-list control group, the intervention group had a faster reduction in depression symptom scores [OR=0.00,95% CI, 0.00-0.003] and faster increase in functioning scores [OR=4.82, 95% CI, 2.39 to 9.75], social support scores [OR=2.68, 95% CI, 1.50-4.78] and self-esteem [OR=1.90, 95% CI 1.48-2.44]. Sixty-three percent of participants strongly agreed that the intervention had reduced their depression and would recommend it to other depressed individuals. LIMITATIONS: Inadequate study power due to small sample sizes may result in imprecise confidence intervals even when there are significant differences. The use of non-random samples could have resulted in selection bias. CONCLUSIONS: This intervention appears feasible, acceptable and promising in treating depression and restoring function, enhancing social support and self-esteem. Larger and randomized evaluations are warranted.</td>

      <td>Age at antiretroviral therapy initiation predicts immune recovery, death, and loss to follow-up among HIV-infected adults in urban Zambia.</td>
      <td>We analyzed the association of age at antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation with CD4(+) T cell count recovery, death, and loss to follow-up (LTFU) among HIV-infected adults in Zambia. We compared baseline characteristics of patients by sex and age at ART initiation [categorized as 16-29 years, 30-39 years, 40-49 years, 50-59 years, and 60 years and older]. We used the medication possession ratio to assess adherence and analysis of covariance to measure the adjusted change in CD4(+) T cell count during ART. Using Cox proportional hazard regression, we examined the association of age with death and LTFU. In a secondary analysis, we repeated models with age as a continuous variable. Among 92,130 HIV-infected adults who initiated ART, the median age was 34 years and 6,281 (6.8%) were aged >/=50 years. Compared with 16-29 year olds, 40-49 year olds (-46 cells/mm(3)), 50-59 year olds (-53 cells/mm(3)), and 60+ year olds (-60 cells/mm(3)) had reduced CD4(+) T cell gains during ART. The adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) for death was increased for individuals aged >/=40 years (AHR 1.25 for 40-49 year olds, 1.56 for 50-59 year olds, and 2.97 for 60+ year olds). Adherence and retention in care were poorest among 16-29 year olds but similar in other groups. As a continuous variable, a 5-year increase in age predicted reduced CD4(+) T cell count recovery and increased risk of death. Increased age at ART initiation was associated with poorer clinical outcomes, while age <30 years was associated with a higher likelihood of being lost to follow-up. HIV treatment guidelines should consider age-specific recommendations.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: Health related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important outcome helping to understand the impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We examined and compared the HRQoL in relation to ART status among HIV-infected patients in a public sector service in Cape Town, South Africa. In addition, we aimed to examine the relationship between ART status and HRQoL according to CD4 count strata. METHODS: A cross sectional study sample of 903 HIV-infected patients who were categorized as not receiving ART (ART-naive) or receiving first-line ART for > 6 months (ART). HRQoL outcomes were compared in the two groups. HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D (five domains) and Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-5D VAS). RESULTS: Of the total sample, 435 were categorised as ART naive (76% women) and 468 were on ART (78% women). There were no significant associations between groups for most of the EQ-5D domains, however ART-naive experienced a significantly greater problem with mobility than the ART group. Being ART-naive (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.08 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63- 7.89) and obese 2.78 (95% CI 1.24- 6.22) were identified as predictors for increased mobility problems in multivariate analysis. In addition, receiving ART (5.61 difference; 95% CI 2.50 - 8.72) and having some source of income (4.76; 95% CI 1.63 -7.89) were identified as predictors for a higher EQ-5D VAS score. When grouped according to CD4 count strata, there were no significant difference between groups for most of the EQ-5D domains, however the ART-naive group indicated having significantly greater problems under the CD4 count of >500 cells/muL in the anxiety/depression domain (22.4% vs 8.8%, p = 0.018) and significantly lower EQ-5D VAS scores under the CD4 counts of </= 200 cells/muL (median 80 (IQR 60-90) vs 90 (IQR 80-100), p = 0.0003) and 201-350 cells/muL (median 80 (IQR 70-90) vs 90 (80-100), p = 0.0004) compared to ART group. CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL (self-rated health state) was improved with ART use, including those with immunocompromised status, which may be relevant to the public sector ART program in South Africa.</td>

      <td>Decentralization of HIV care and treatment services in Central Province, Kenya.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Since 2006, the government of Kenya began decentralizing HIV care from secondary health facilities (SHF) to an expanded network, including primary health facilities (PHF). We evaluated the impact of this strategy on enrollment, care, and outcomes among adult patients in Central Province, Kenya, from 2006 to 2010. METHODS: We analyzed electronic patient-level data for 26,690 patients at 15 SHF and 22 PHF. Enrollment, patient, and facility characteristics and patterns in CD4 testing, World Health Organization staging, and antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation were compared between SHF and PHF. Survival analysis was used to estimate cumulative death and loss to follow-up (LTF) rates in PHF and SHF. Multivariate competing risks regression and Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to identify correlates of LTF and death. RESULTS: Enrollment in PHF increased mainly between 2007 and 2009, representing 5% and 25% of all new enrollments, respectively. CD4 test provision and World Health Organization staging, time to ART initiation, and CD4 count at ART initiation were for the most part similar between PHF and SHF. In multivariate analyses, pre-ART patients enrolled in PHF had a lower risk of LTF than those enrolled in SHF (SHR = 0.77, 95% confidence interval: 0.61 to 0.96). No differences in risk of death among pre-ART patients or in LTF or death among ART patients were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Enrollment at PHF increased substantially during the period; death rates were comparable between PHF and SHF, whereas LTF among pre-ART patients was lower at PHF. This suggests that decentralization can be a successful strategy for expanding HIV care.</td>

      <td>Delayed switch of antiretroviral therapy after virologic failure associated with elevated mortality among HIV-infected adults in Africa.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: Routine monitoring of plasma HIV RNA among HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is unavailable in many resource-limited settings. Alternative monitoring approaches correlate poorly with virologic failure and can substantially delay switch to second-line therapy. We evaluated the impact of delayed switch on mortality among patients with virologic failure in Africa. DESIGN: A cohort. METHODS: We examined patients with confirmed virologic failure on first-line nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimens from four cohorts with serial HIV RNA monitoring in Uganda and South Africa. Marginal structural models aimed to estimate the effect of delayed switch on mortality in a hypothetical trial in which switch time was randomly assigned. Inverse probability weights adjusted for measured confounders including time-updated CD4+ T-cell count and HIV RNA. Results: Among 823 patients with confirmed virologic failure, the cumulative incidence of switch 180 days after failure was 30% [95% confidence interval (CI) 27-33]. The majority of patients (74%) had not failed immunologically as defined by WHO criteria by the time of virologic failure. Adjusted mortality was higher for individuals who remained on first-line therapy than for those who had switched [odds ratio (OR) 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.2]. Among those without immunologic failure, the relative harm of failure to switch was similar (OR 2.4; 95% CI 0.99-5.8) to that of the entire cohort, although of borderline statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Among HIV-infected patients with confirmed virologic failure on first-line ART, remaining on first-line therapy led to an increase in mortality relative to switching. Our results suggest that detection and response to confirmed virologic failure could decrease mortality.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: Women initiating antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy have high rates of dropout, particularly after delivery. We aimed to identify challenges to postpartum retention in care under Option B+, which expands antiretroviral therapy access to all HIV-positive pregnant women regardless of CD4 count. METHODOLOGY: We performed 2 semi-structured interviews (SSI, n = 50) and 1 focus group discussion (n = 8) with HIV-positive women at Witkoppen Health and Welfare Centre, a primary care facility in Johannesburg, South Africa, that is one of the only clinics offering Option B+ in South Africa. RESULTS: Fifty women completed the SSI before delivery, and 48 (96%) completed the second SSI within 3 months of delivery. Median age was 28 years (interquartile range: 26-34); most women worked (62%) or had worked in the previous year (18%). Postpartum women attending HIV care perceived that barriers to HIV care after delivery among other women included the belief that mothers care more about the baby's health than their own (29.2%, 14/48), women were "ignorant" or "irresponsible" (16.7%, 8/48), negative clinic staff treatment (12.5%, 6/48), and denial or lack of disclosure of HIV status (10.4% each, 5/48). Experienced barriers included lack of money (18.0%, 9/50), work conflict (6.0%, 3/50), and negative staff treatment (6.0%, 3/50). During the focus group discussion, 3 main themes emerged: conflict with work commitment, negative treatment from health-care workers, and lack of disclosure related to stigma. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a complex set of interconnected barriers to retaining postpartum women in HIV care under Option B+, including structural, personal, and societal barriers. The importance of postpartum HIV care for the mother's own health must be embraced by health-care workers and public health programs.</td>

      <td>The HIV-1 subtype C has been substituting the subtype B population in southern Brazil. This phenomenon has been previously described in other countries, suggesting that subtype C may possess greater fitness than other subtypes. The HIV-1 long-terminal repeat (LTR) is an important regulatory region critical for the viral life cycle. Sequence insertions immediately upstream of the viral enhancer are known as the most frequent naturally occurring length polimorphisms (MFNLP). Previous reports demonstrated that the MFNLP could lead to the duplication of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) enhancing the activity of the HIV-1 subtype C LTR. Here, we amplified and sequenced the LTR obtained from proviral DNA samples collected from patients infected with subtype C from the Southern Region of Brazil (naive or treatment failure) and Mozambique (only naive). We confirm the presence of different types of insertions in the LTR sequences of both the countries leading to the creation of additional TFBS. In the Brazilian clinical samples, the frequency of the sequence insertion was significantly higher in subjects experiencing treatment failure than in antiretroviral naive patients.</td>

      <td>Few reports have examined the impact of HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in resource-limited settings where there are fewer regimen choices and limited pretherapy/posttherapy resistance testing. In this study, we examined TDR prevalence in Kampala and Mbarara, Uganda and assessed its virologic consequences after antiretroviral therapy initiation. We sequenced the HIV-1 protease/reverse transcriptase from n=81 and n=491 treatment-naive participants of the Uganda AIDS Rural Treatment Outcomes (UARTO) pilot study in Kampala (AMU 2002-2004) and main cohort in Mbarara (MBA 2005-2010). TDR-associated mutations were defined by the WHO 2009 surveillance mutation list. Posttreatment viral load data were available for both populations. Overall TDR prevalence was 7% (Kampala) and 3% (Mbarara) with no significant time trend. There was a slight but statistically nonsignificant trend indicating that the presence of TDR was associated with a worse treatment outcome. Virologic suppression (</=400 copies/ml within 6 months posttherapy initiation) was achieved in 87% and 96% of participants with wildtype viruses versus 67% and 83% of participants with TDR (AMU, MBA p=0.2 and 0.1); time to suppression (log-rank p=0.3 and p=0.05). Overall, 85% and 96% of study participants achieved suppression regardless of TDR status. Surprisingly, among the TDR cases, approximately half still achieved suppression; the presence of pretherapy K103N while on nevirapine and fewer active drugs in the first regimen were most often observed with failures. The majority of patients benefited from the local HIV care system even without resistance monitoring. Overall, TDR prevalence was relatively low and its presence did not always imply treatment failure.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: Cohorts describing cause specific mortality in HIV-infected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) operate on an outpatient basis. Hospitalized patients represent the spectrum and burden of severe morbidity and mortality in patients on ART. OBJECTIVE: To determine the causes and outcomes of hospitalization among adults receiving ART. METHODS: A prospective cohort study. We enrolled 201 participants (50% female) with median (IQR) age and CD4 count of 34 (28-40) years and 91(29-211) cells/uL respectively. RESULTS: The most frequent causes of hospitalization were tuberculosis (TB) (37, 18%), cryptococcal meningitis (22, 11%), zidovudine (AZT) - associated anemia (19, 10%), sepsis (10, 5%) and Kaposi's sarcoma (10, 5%). Forty two patients (21%) died: 10 (24%) had TB, 8 (19%) had cryptococcal meningitis and 5 (12%) had sepsis, 9 (21%) had undiagnosed neurological syndromes while 10 (24%) had other illnesses. Predictors of death included low Karnofsky performance score of < 40 (OR, 21.1; CI 1.43- 31.6) and age >34 years (OR, 7.65; CI 1.09- 53.8). CONCLUSIONS: Opportunistic infections, malignancy and AZT-associated anemia contributed to most hospitalizations and mortality. It is important to intensify prevention, screening, and treatment for these opportunistic diseases and early ART initiation in HIV-infected patients. Tenofovir-based regimens, unless contraindicated should be scaled up to replace AZT-based regimens as first line ART drugs.</td>

      <td>Efficacy of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy, Mansa, Zambia.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) decreases adverse effects of malaria during pregnancy. Zambia implemented its IPTp-SP programme in 2003. Emergence of SP-resistant Plasmodium falciparum threatens this strategy. The quintuple mutant haplotype (substitutions in N51I, C59R, S108N in dhfr and A437G and K540E in dhps genes), is associated with SP treatment failure in non-pregnant patients with malaria. This study examined efficacy of IPTp-SP and presence of the quintuple mutant among pregnant women in Mansa, Zambia. METHODS: In Mansa, an area with high malaria transmission, HIV-negative pregnant women presenting to two antenatal clinics for the 1st dose of IPTp-SP with asymptomatic parasitaemia were enrolled and microscopy for parasitaemia was done weekly for five weeks. Outcomes were parasitological failure and adequate parasitological response (no parasitaemia during follow-up). Polymerase chain reaction assays were employed to distinguish recrudescence from reinfection, and identify molecular markers of SP resistance. Survival analysis included those who had reinfection and incomplete follow-up (missed at least one follow-up). RESULTS: Of the 109 women included in the study, 58 (53%) completed all follow-up, 34 (31%) had incomplete follow-up, and 17 (16%) were lost to follow-up after day 0. Of those who had complete follow-up, 15 (26%, 95% confidence interval [CI] [16-38]) had parasitological failure. For the 92 women included in the survival analysis, median age was 20 years (interquartile range [IQR] 18-22), median gestational age was 22 weeks (IQR range 20-24), and 57% were primigravid. There was no difference in time to failure in primigravid versus multigravid women. Of the 84 women with complete haplotype data for the aforementioned loci of the dhfr and dhps genes, 53 (63%, 95% CI [50-70]) had quintuple mutants (two with an additional mutation in A581G of dhps). Among women with complete follow-up and quintuple mutants, 22% had parasitological failure versus 0% without (p = 0.44). CONCLUSIONS: While underpowered, this study found 26% failure rates of SP given the moderate prevalence of the quintuple mutant haplotype. Despite the presence of resistance, SP retained some efficacy in clearing parasites in pregnant women, and may remain a viable option for IPTp in Zambia.</td>

      <td>Measures of viral load using Abbott RealTime HIV-1 Assay on venous and fingerstick dried blood spots from provider-collected specimens in Malawian District Hospitals.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Viral suppression is a key indicator of antiretroviral therapy (ART) response among HIV-infected patients. Dried blood spots (DBS) are an appealing alternative to conventional plasma-based virologic testing, improving access to monitoring in resource-limited settings. However, validity of DBS obtained from fingerstick in field settings remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: Investigate feasibility and accuracy of DBS vs plasma collected by healthcare workers in real-world settings of remote hospitals in Malawi. Compare venous DBS to fingerstick DBS for identifying treatment failure. STUDY DESIGN: We recruited patients from ART clinics at two district hospitals in Malawi, collecting plasma, venous DBS (vDBS), and fingerstick DBS (fsDBS) cards for the first 149 patients, and vDBS and fsDBS only for the subsequent 398 patients. Specimens were tested using Abbott RealTime HIV-1 Assay (lower detection limit 40 copies/ml (plasma) and 550 copies/ml (DBS)). RESULTS: 21/149 (14.1%) had detectable viremia (>1.6 log copies/ml), 13 of which were detectable for plasma, vDBS, and fsDBS. Linear regression demonstrated high correlation for plasma vs. DBS (vDBS: beta=1.19, R(2)=0.93 (p<0.0001); fsDBS beta=1.20, R(2)=0.90 (p<0.0001)) and vDBS vs. fsDBS (beta=0.88, R(2)=0.73, (p<0.0001)). Mean difference between plasma and vDBS was 1.1 log copies/ml [SD: 0.27] and plasma and fsDBS 1.1 log copies/ml [SD: 0.31]. At 5000 copies/ml, sensitivity was 100%, and specificity was 98.6% and 97.8% for vDBS and fsDBS, respectively, compared to plasma. CONCLUSIONS: DBS from venipuncture and fingerstick perform well at the failure threshold of 5000 copies/ml. Fingerstick specimen source may improve access to virologic treatment monitoring in resource-limited settings given task-shifting in high-volume, low-resource facilities.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment for tuberculosis (TB) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients in resource-poor settings receiving lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/r) based second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) has yet to be determined. In South Africa, clinicians are advised to use 'double-dose' LPV/r dosed at 800 mg/200 mg twice daily during anti-tuberculosis treatment. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective study of HIV-infected patients who received >/=2 months of double-dose LPV/r-based ART during concomitant rifampicin-containing anti-tuberculosis treatment. We used standard definitions for TB and HIV outcomes; virological failure was defined as a viral load >1000 copies/ml. During co-administration, gastro-intestinal toxicity occurred in 9/25 (36%) patients, a symptomatic rise in aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase of any grade was noted in 3 (12%), with two Grade 3 events, and 3 (12%) patients required treatment discontinuation. Outcomes were favourable, with 20/25 (80%) patients achieving TB treatment success and virological failure observed among 3 (12%) patients during co-administration. CONCLUSION: We found the use of double-dose LPV/r during simultaneous standard anti-tuberculosis treatment to be an effective and reasonably well tolerated interim strategy.</td>

      <td>Tuberculosis incidence and treatment completion among Ugandan prison inmates.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The Uganda Prisons Service (UPS) is responsible for the health of approximately 32 500 inmates in 233 prisons. In 2008 a rapid UPS assessment estimated TB prevalence at 654/100 000, three times that of the general population (183/100 000). Although treatment programs exist, little is known about treatment completion in sub-Saharan African prisons. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of Ugandan prisoners diagnosed with TB from June 2011 to November 2012. We analyzed TB diagnosis, TB-HIV comorbidity and treatment completion from national registers and tracked prison transfers and releases. RESULTS: A total of 469 prisoners were diagnosed with TB over the 1.5-year period (incidence 955/100 000 person-years). Of 466 prisoners starting treatment, 48% completed treatment, 43% defaulted, 5% died and 4% were currently on treatment. During treatment, 12% of prisoners remaining in the same prison defaulted, 53% of transfers defaulted and 81% of those released were lost to follow-up. The odds of defaulting were 8.36 times greater among prisoners who were transferred during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: TB incidence and treatment default are high among Ugandan prisoners. Strategies to improve treatment completion and prevent multidrug resistance could include avoiding transfer of TB patients, improving communications between prisons to ensure treatment follow-up after transfer and facilitating transfer to community clinics for released prisoners.</td>

      <td>Childhood tuberculosis (TB) is a marker of TB transmission within a community. We present the fourth consecutive survey of children with culture-confirmed TB at a hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, from 2009 to 2011. In comparison to the previous survey, the rate of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) has stabilised and the human immunodeficiency virus infection rate has declined. We also report on the first systematic surveillance of resistance to second-line drugs. Two concerns following from this are the high rate (22%) of ofloxacin resistance in MDR-TB isolates, and the discordance between isolates with an inhA promoter region mutation, usually implying ethionamide (ETH) resistance, and phenotypic ETH results in these isolates showing ETH susceptibility.</td>

      <td>Four-year retention and risk factors for attrition among members of community ART groups in Tete, Mozambique.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: Community ART groups (CAG), peer support groups involved in community ART distribution and mutual psychosocial support, were piloted to respond to staggering antiretroviral treatment (ART) attrition in Mozambique. To understand the impact of CAG on long-term retention, we estimated mortality and lost-to-follow-up (LTFU) rates and assessed predictors for attrition. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. Kaplan-Meier techniques were used to estimate mortality and LTFU in CAG. Individual- and CAG-level predictors of attrition were assessed using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for site-level clustering. RESULTS: Mortality and LTFU rates among 5729 CAG members were, respectively, 2.1 and 0.1 per 100 person-years. Retention was 97.7% at 12 months, 96.0% at 24 months, 93.4% at 36 months and 91.8% at 48 months. At individual level, attrition in CAG was significantly associated with immunosuppression when joining a CAG, and being male. At CAG level, attrition was associated with lack of rotational representation at the clinic, lack of a regular CD4 count among fellow members and linkage to a rural or district clinic compared with linkage to a peri-urban clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term retention in this community-based ART model compares favourably with published data on stable ART patients. Nevertheless, to reduce attrition, further efforts need to be made to enroll patients earlier on ART, promote health-seeking behaviour, especially for men, promote a strong peer dynamic to assure rotational representation at the clinic and regular CD4 follow-up and reinforce referral of sick patients.</td>

      <td>The challenge to avoid anti-malarial medicine stock-outs in an era of funding partners: the case of Tanzania.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Between 2007 and 2013, the Tanzanian public sector received 93.1 million doses of first-line anti-malarial artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in the form of artemether-lumefantrine entirely supplied by funding partners. The introduction of a health facility ACT stock monitoring system using SMS technology by the National Malaria Control Programme in mid 2011 revealed a high frequency of stock-outs of ACT in primary care public health facilities. The objective of this study was to determine the pattern of availability of ACT and possible causes of observed stock-outs across public health facilities in Tanzania since mid-2011. METHODS: Data were collected weekly by the mobile phone reporting tool SMS for Life on ACT availability from over 5,000 public health facilities in Tanzania starting from September 2011 to December 2012. Stock data for all four age-dose levels of ACT across health facilities were summarized and supply of ACT at the national level was also documented. RESULTS: Over the period of 15 months, on average 29% of health facilities in Tanzania were completely stocked out of all four-age dose levels of the first-line anti-malarial with a median duration of total stock-out of six weeks. Patterns of total stock-out by region ranged from a low of 9% to a high of 52%. The ACT stock-outs were most likely caused by: a) insufficient ACT supplies entering Tanzania (e.g. in 2012 Tanzania received 10.9 million ACT doses compared with a forecast demand of 14.4 million doses); and b) irregular pattern of ACT supply (several months with no ACT stock). CONCLUSION: The reduced ACT availability and irregular pattern of supply were due to cumbersome bureaucratic processes and delays both within the country and from the main donor, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Tanzania should invest in strengthening both the supply system and the health information system using mHealth solutions such as SMS for Life. This will continue to assist in tracking ACT availability across the country where all partners work towards more streamlined, demand driven and accountable procurement and supply chain systems.</td>

      <td>Adherence in the treatment of patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis and HIV in South Africa: a prospective cohort study.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB)/HIV coinfection is difficult to treat with frequent adverse drug reactions and associated with high mortality. Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ARV) and second-line TB medications may reduce mortality, prevent amplification of drug resistance, and improve outcomes. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of XDR-TB patients on treatment in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Adherence to ARV and TB medications was assessed separately at baseline and monthly. Knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs were assessed at baseline. Optimal adherence was defined as self-report of taking all pills in the previous 7 days; missing any pills was defined as suboptimal adherence. Primary outcome was optimal adherence 6 months after initiation of XDR-TB treatment to TB medications, ARV, and both ("dual adherence"). RESULTS: One hundred four XDR-TB patients (79.8% HIV coinfected, 84.3% on ARV at enrollment) were enrolled and followed monthly (median 8 visits; interquartile range: 4-12). Six-month optimal adherence was higher for ARV (88.2%) than TB medications (67.7%) (P < 0.001). Low educational attainment, male gender, and year of enrollment were independently associated with dual suboptimal adherence. At baseline, participants indicated that XDR-TB was curable (76.0%), HIV and TB were linked (81.7%), and ARV improves TB outcomes (72.1%). Baseline knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs did not predict subsequent adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Medication adherence was significantly higher for ARV than for TB medications in this cohort. Short-course treatment regimens for drug-resistant TB with lower pill burden may increase adherence and improve outcomes in XDR-TB/HIV. Programmatic support for dual adherence is critical in the treatment of drug-resistant TB and HIV.</td>

      <td>Totally drug-resistant tuberculosis and adjunct therapies.</td>
      <td>The first cases of totally drug-resistant (TDR) tuberculosis (TB) were reported in Italy 10 years ago; more recently, cases have also been reported in Iran, India and South Africa. Although there is no consensus on terminology, it is most commonly described as 'resistance to all first- and second-line drugs used to treat TB'. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) acquires drug resistance mutations in a sequential fashion under suboptimal drug pressure due to monotherapy, inadequate dosing, treatment interruptions and drug interactions. The treatment of TDR-TB includes antibiotics with disputed or minimal effectiveness against M.tb, and the fatality rate is high. Comorbidities such as diabetes and infection with human immunodeficiency virus further impact on TB treatment options and survival rates. Several new drug candidates with novel modes of action are under late-stage clinical evaluation (e.g., delamanid, bedaquiline, SQ109 and sutezolid). 'Repurposed' antibiotics have also recently been included in the treatment of extensively drug resistant TB. However, because of mutations in M.tb, drugs will not provide a cure for TB in the long term. Adjunct TB therapies, including therapeutic vaccines, vitamin supplementation and/or repurposing of drugs targeting biologically and clinically relevant molecular pathways, may achieve better clinical outcomes in combination with standard chemotherapy. Here, we review broader perspectives of drug resistance in TB and potential adjunct treatment options.</td>

      <td>HIV-1 viral load (VL) monitoring is recommended but seldom performed in resource-constrained countries. An evaluation of patients receiving first-line antiretroviral therapy in a multicountry PEPFAR program (RV288) was performed to determine the rates and predictors of virologic suppression. Resistance data from treatment failures are available from Uganda and Nigeria. Each country enrolled 325 subjects into this cross-sectional study. Subjects on first-line therapy were randomly selected for HIV RNA testing (viral load). Regimens included efavirenz or nevirapine with zidovudine/lamivudine or tenofovir/lamivudine. VL was determined from plasma using the Roche COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test, High Pure System v1.0 (47 copies/ml). Genotypic resistance testing was performed on samples with VL>1,000 copies/ml. From Uganda, 85% of subjects were undetectable while 7% (23/325) had VL>1,000 copies/ml. The HIV-1 subtype distribution was as follows: A=47.6%, C=14.3%, and D=38.1%. No resistance mutations were found in 14% of subjects. All subjects with resistance had the M184V mutation. Of subjects failing a zidovudine regimen less than 1 year, 88% (7/8) had no thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs), compared to 50% (4/8) failing greater than 1 year. Four subjects (25%) had more than two mutations from the TAM-1 pathway (41L, 210W, 215Y). In Nigeria, 82% were undetectable while 14% (45/325) had VL>1,000 copies/ml. HIV-1 subtype distribution was as follows: 62.8%=CRF02_AG, 34%=pure G, and 2.8%=A. Of the 35 genotyped subjects, 14% (5/35) had no resistance mutations. Of the remainder, 10% (3/30) had no nucleoside analogue mutations while 33% (10/30) had only M184V along with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations. Forty percent (10/25) of subjects on zidovudine failed without TAMs. Another 25% (5/25) of subjects failing on zidovudine had more than two TAM-1 mutations. Individuals failing first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) may retain sensitivity to one or more nucleoside analogues from the regimen. Knowledge of drug resistance patterns allow for selection of drugs that can be recycled in future regimens. Accumulation of resistance mutations may compromise future treatment options.</td>

      <td>Depressive symptoms have been shown to independently affect both antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and HIV clinical outcomes in high-income countries. We examined the prospective relationship between depressive symptoms and adherence, virologic failure, and suppressed immune function in people living with HIV/AIDS in Tanzania. Data from 403 study participants who were on stable ART and engaged in HIV clinical care were analyzed. We assessed crude and adjusted associations of depressive symptoms and ART adherence, both at baseline and at 12 months, using logistic regression. We used logistic generalized estimating equations to assess the association and 95% confidence intervals (CI) between depressive symptoms and both virologic failure and suppressed immune function. Ten percent of participants reported moderate or severe depressive symptoms at baseline and 31% of participants experienced virologic failure (>150 copies/ml) over two years. Depressive symptoms were associated with greater odds of reported medication nonadherence at both baseline (Odds Ratio [OR] per 1-unit increase = 1.18, 95% CI [1.12, 1.24]) and 12 months (OR = 1.08, 95% CI [1.03, 1.14]). By contrast, increases in depressive symptom score were inversely related to both virologic failure (OR = 0.93, 95% CI [0.87, 1.00]) and immune system suppression (OR = 0.88, 95% CI [0.79, 0.99]), though the association between depressive symptoms and clinical outcomes was less precise than for the association with nonadherence. Findings indicate a positive association between depressive symptoms and nonadherence, and also an inverse relationship between depressive symptoms and clinical outcomes, possibly due to informative loss to follow-up.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: Drug resistance monitoring of the paediatric HIV-1-infected population is required to optimize treatment success and preserve future treatment options. OBJECTIVES: To explore the current knowledge of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) in naive and pretreated HIV-1-infected paediatric populations across diverse settings and sampling time periods. METHODS: PubMed database screened until May 2013. We selected publications including data on transmitted (TDR) and acquired drug resistance mutation (DRM) rates and/or pol sequences for HIVDR testing in paediatric patients. We recorded the children's country, age, study period, number of children with pol sequences, presence or absence of antiretroviral treatment (ART) at sampling time, viral region sequenced, HIVDR rate to the three main drug classes (single, double or triple), the considered resistance mutation list and performed assay, specimen type, HIV-1 variants and subtyping methodology when available. RESULTS: Forty-one selected studies showed HIVDR data from 2538 paediatric HIV-1-infected patients (558 naive and 1980 pretreated) from 30 countries in Africa (11), Asia (6), America (10) and Europe (3). Both TDR and DRM prevalence were reported in 9 studies, only TDR in 6 and only DRM in 26. HIVDR prevalence varied across countries and periods. Most studies used in-house resistance assays using plasma or infected cells. HIV-1 non-B variants were prevalent in 18 paediatric cohorts of the 24 countries with reported subtypes. Only five countries (Uganda, Spain, the UK, Brazil and Thailand) presented resistance data in >/=200 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic and periodic studies among infected children are crucial to design a more suitable first- or second-line therapy.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: In the era of more efficacious prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) regimens, documenting the profile of drug resistance in HIV-infected infants and young children is critical to our efforts to improve care and treatment for children. METHODS: HIV drug resistance mutations in plasma virus were ascertained using population sequencing among 230 newly diagnosed HIV-infected children under 2 years of age recruited in Johannesburg, South Africa, during 2011. By this time, more effective PMTCT regimens, including combination antiretroviral therapy for pregnant women, were being implemented. RESULTS: Two-thirds (67.4%) of HIV-infected children had been exposed to some form of maternal (89%) and/or infant (97%) PMTCT. Among PMTCT-exposed, 56.8% had nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), 14.8% nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), and 1.3% protease inhibitor mutations. NNRTI mutations were strongly related to younger age. The remaining third (32.6%) had no reported or recorded PMTCT exposures, but resistance to NNRTI was detected in 24.0%, NRTI in 10.7%, and protease inhibitor in 1.3%. CONCLUSION: The new PMTCT strategies dramatically reduce the number of children who acquire infection, but among those who do become infected, NNRTI resistance prevalence is high. In this South African setting with high PMTCT coverage, almost a quarter of children with no reported or recorded PMTCT also have drug resistance mutations. PMTCT history is an inadequate means of ruling out pretreatment drug resistance. Our results support the use of protease inhibitor-based first-line regimens in HIV-infected infants and young children regardless of PMTCT history.</td>

      <td>Factors influencing treatment failure in HIV positive adult patients on first line antiretroviral therapy.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Risk factors for treatment failure in HIV positive adults have not been studied extensively in Zimbabwe. AIM: To investigate socio-demographic, psychosocial and antiretroviral drug related factors as possible risk factors for treatment failure. OBJECTIVE: To compare the accuracy and reliability of CD4 count results in diagnosing treatment failure versus viral load results. DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Harare Central Hospital adult opportunistic infections clinic. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and eighteen (118) HIV positive participants on 1st line antiretroviral therapy (any 1 of stavudine, tenofovir or zidovudine combined with lamivudine and nevirapine or efavirenz) for at least 1 year. Participants were conveniently sampled. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: First line treatment failure as defined according to World Health Organisation (WHO) 2010 guidelines. RESULTS: Factors associated with higher odds of treatment failure were severe depression [OR 3.7; p-value 0.002; 95% CI 1.6-8.5] and discontinuing ART [OR 4.4; p-value 0.02; 95% CI 1.3-14.7]. Factors associated with lower odds of treatment failure were age = 42 [OR 0.3; p-value 0.007; 95% CI 0.1-0.7], taking ART on time [OR 0.2; p-value 0.02; 95% CI 0.05-0.8], time on ART > 4 years [OR 0.6; p-value 0.02; 95% CI 0.3-0.9] and female sex [OR 0.4; p-value 0.02; 95% CI 0.2-0.8]. There was statistically significant difference between CD4 count and viral load results in diagnosing treatment failure [OR 8.7; p-value 0.0005; 95% CI 3.6-21.2]. CONCLUSION: Severe depression and discontinuing ART predisposed to treatment failure. CD4 counts were not as reliable as viral load measurements in diagnosing treatment failure.</td>

      <td>National profile and treatment outcomes of patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis in Benin.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, there is a dearth of published literature on extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB). OBJECTIVE: To describe demographic, diagnostic and HIV-status characteristics of patients with EPTB in Benin, their treatment outcomes, and among those who completed their treatment in the Centre National Hospitalier de Pneumo-Phtisiologie (CNHP-P), the proportion whose bodyweight increased during treatment. MATERIAL AND FINDINGS: This was a retrospective cohort study with comparisons made between EPTB and new smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (NPTB) patients diagnosed in the country from January to December 2011. There were 383 EPTB patients (9% of all TB cases) with a mean age of 35 years, male/female ratio of 1.3 and important regional variation. There were significantly more females (p = 0.001), children <15 years (p<0.001) and HIV-positive patients (p = 0.005) with EPTB compared with NPTB. Pleural effusion, spinal and lymph node tuberculosis accounted for 66% of all EPTB. Children <15 years represented 16% of cases, with lymph node disease being most common among them (p<0.001). Of 130 EPTB patients registered in CNHP-P, 7% had a confirmed bacteriological/histological diagnosis. There were 331 (86%) patients who successfully completed treatment. More patients with EPTB were lost-to-follow-up compared with NPTB (p<0.001) with all these patients from one region. The best treatment completion rates were in children <15 years (OR:3.5, 95%CI:1.0-14.8) while patients with pleural effusion and ascites had the worst outcomes. Of 72 HIV-coinfected patients, 88% were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV-positive status was associated with poor outcomes while those on ART fared better. In the CNHP-P, more than 80% who completed their treatment showed an increase in bodyweight and this was more evident in HIV-positive compared with HIV-negative patients (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Patients with EPTB generally do well in Benin, although the TB Programme would benefit through more attention to accurate diagnosis and earlier start of ART in HIV-infected patients.</td>

      <td>Clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of making third-line antiretroviral therapy available in sub-Saharan Africa: a model-based analysis in Cote d'Ivoire.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-infected adults who fail second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) often do not have access to third-line ART. We examined the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of making third-line ART available in Cote d'Ivoire. METHODS: We used a simulation model to compare 4 strategies after second-line ART failure: continue second-line ART (C-ART2), continue second-line ART with an adherence reinforcement intervention (AR-ART2), immediate switch to third-line ART (IS-ART3), and continue second-line ART with adherence reinforcement, switching patients with persistent failure to third-line ART (AR-ART3). Third-line ART consisted of a boosted-darunavir plus raltegravir-based regimen. Primary outcomes were 10-year survival and lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), in $/year of life saved (YLS). ICERs below $3585 (3 times the country per capita gross domestic product) were considered cost-effective. RESULTS: Ten-year survival was 6.0% with C-ART2, 17.0% with AR-ART2, 35.4% with IS-ART3, and 37.2% with AR-ART3. AR-ART2 was cost-effective ($1100/YLS). AR-ART3 had an ICER of $3600/YLS and became cost-effective if the cost of third-line ART decreased by <1%. IS-ART3 was less effective and more costly than AR-ART3. Results were robust to wide variations in the efficacy of third-line ART and of the adherence reinforcement, as well as in the cost of second-line ART. CONCLUSIONS: Access to third-line ART combined with an intense adherence reinforcement phase, used as a tool to distinguish between patients who can still benefit from their current second-line regimen and those who truly need third-line ART would provide substantial survival benefits. With minor decreases in drug costs, this strategy would be cost-effective.</td>

      <td>Monitoring prevention or emergence of HIV drug resistance: results of a population-based foundational survey of early warning indicators in mainland Tanzania.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In Tanzania, routine individual-level testing for HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) using laboratory genotyping and phenotyping is not feasible due to resource constraints. To monitor the prevention or emergence of HIVDR at a population level, WHO developed generic strategies to be adapted by countries, which include a set of early warning indicators (EWIs). METHODS: To establish a baseline of EWIs, we conducted a retrospective longitudinal survey of 35 purposively sampled care and treatment clinics in 17 regions of mainland Tanzania. We extracted data relevant for four EWIs (ART prescribing practices, patients lost to follow-up 12 months after ART initiation, retention on first-line ART at 12 months, and ART clinic appointment keeping in the first 12 months) from the patient monitoring system on patients who initiated ART at each respective facility in 2010. We uploaded patient information into WHO HIVResNet excel-based tool to compute national and facility averages of the EWIs and tested for associations between various programmatic factors and EWI performance using Fisher's Exact Test. RESULTS: All sampled facilities met the WHO EWI target (100%) for ART prescribing practices. However, the national averages for patients lost to follow-up 12 months after ART initiation, retention on first-line ART at 12 months, and ART clinic appointment keeping in the first 12 months fell short, at 26%, 54% and 38%, respectively, compared to the WHO targets </= 20%, >/= 70%, and >/= 80%. Clinics with fewer patients lost to follow-up 12 months after ART initiation and more patients retained on first-line-ART at 12 months were more likely to have their patients spend the longest time in the facility (including wait-time and time with providers), (p = 0.011 and 0.007, respectively). CONCLUSION: Tanzania performed very well in EWI 1a, ART prescribing practices. However, its performance in other three EWIs was far below the WHO targets. This study provides a baseline for future monitoring of EWIs in Tanzania and highlights areas for improvement in the management of ART patients in order not only to prevent emergence of HIVDR due to programmatic factors, but also to improve the quality of life for ART patients.</td>

      <td>Global control of tuberculosis: from extensively drug-resistant to untreatable tuberculosis.</td>
      <td>Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis is a burgeoning global health crisis mainly affecting economically active young adults, and has high mortality irrespective of HIV status. In some countries such as South Africa, drug-resistant tuberculosis represents less than 3% of all cases but consumes more than a third of the total national budget for tuberculosis, which is unsustainable and threatens to destabilise national tuberculosis programmes. However, concern about drug-resistant tuberculosis has been eclipsed by that of totally and extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis--ie, resistance to all or nearly all conventional first-line and second-line antituberculosis drugs. In this Review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, management, implications for health-care workers, and ethical and medicolegal aspects of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis and other resistant strains. Finally, we discuss the emerging problem of functionally untreatable tuberculosis, and the issues and challenges that it poses to public health and clinical practice. The emergence and growth of highly resistant strains of tuberculosis make the development of new drugs and rapid diagnostics for tuberculosis--and increased funding to strengthen global control efforts, research, and advocacy--even more pressing.</td>

      <td>High attrition among HIV-infected patients with advanced disease treated in an intermediary referral center in Maputo, Mozambique.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In Mozambique, antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up has been successfully implemented. However, attrition in care remains a major programmatic challenge. In 2009, an intermediary-level HIV referral center was created in Maputo to ensure access to specialized care for HIV-infected patients with complications (advanced clinical-immunological stage, Kaposi sarcoma, or suspected ART failure). OBJECTIVE: To determine the attrition from care and to identify risk factors that lead to high attrition among patients referred to an intermediary-level HIV referral center. DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study from 2009 to 2011. RESULTS: A total of 1,657 patients were enrolled, 847 (51%) were men, the mean age was 36 years (standard deviation: 11), the mean CD4 count was 27 cells/microl (interquartile range: 11-44), and one-third were severely malnourished. The main reasons for referral were advanced clinical stages (WHO stages 3 and 4, and CD4 count <50 cells/microl) in 70% of the cases, and 19% had Kaposi sarcoma. The overall attrition rate was 28.7 per 100 person-years (PYs) - the mortality rate was 5.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.2-5.9) per 100 PYs, and the loss-to-follow-up rate was 23.7 (95% CI: 21.9-25.6) per 100 PYs. There were 793 attritions - 137 deaths and 656 lost to follow-up (LTFU); 77% of all attrition happened within the first year. The factors independently associated with attrition were male sex (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.0-1.3), low body mass index (aHR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.2-1.8), WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 (aHR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.0-1.6; and aHR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.4-2.5), later year of enrollment (aHR 1.61, 95% CI 1.3-1.9), and 'being already on ART' at enrollment (aHR 13.71, 95% CI 11.4-16.4). CONCLUSIONS: Attrition rates among HIV-infected patients enrolled in an intermediary referral center were high, mainly related to advanced stage of clinical disease. Measures are required to address this, including innovative strategies for HIV-testing uptake, earlier ART initiation and nutritional supplementation, and special attention to men and those who are already on ART at enrolment. Qualitative research is required to understand the reasons for being LTFU and design informed evidence-based interventions.</td>

Women living in the demographic surveillance system who initiated antenatal care (ANC) between July 2011 (date of policy change) and January 2013, were eligible for inclusion. Women who consented were interviewed at home about their health facility attendance and care since pregnancy, including antenatal clinic (ANC) visits, delivery and postpartum care. Women's reports, patient-held health records and clinic health records were manually linked to ascertain service use. Among 395 women, 86% had tested for HIV before the pregnancy, 90% tested or re-tested at the ANC visit, and <1% had never tested. Among 53 mothers known to be HIV-positive before attending ANC, 15 (28%) were already on ART prior to pregnancy. Ten women tested HIV-positive for the first time during pregnancy. Of the 47 HIV-positive mothers not already on ART, 26/47 (55%) started treatment during pregnancy. All but five women who started ART were still on treatment at the time of study interview. HIV testing was almost universal and most women who initiated ART were retained in care. However, nearly half of eligible pregnant women not on ART at the start of ANC had not taken up the invitation to initiate (lifelong) ART by the time of delivery, leaving their infants potentially HIV-exposed.</td>

      <td>Drug resistance in HIV patients with virological failure or slow virological response to antiretroviral therapy in Ethiopia.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The ongoing scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa has prompted the interest in surveillance of transmitted and acquired HIV drug resistance. Resistance data on virological failure and mutations in HIV infected populations initiating treatment in sub-Saharan Africa is sparse. METHODS: HIV viral load (VL) and resistance mutations pre-ART and after 6 months were determined in a prospective cohort study of ART-naive HIV patients initiating first-line therapy in Jimma, Ethiopia. VL measurements were done at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. Genotypic HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) was performed on patients exhibiting virological failure (>1000 copies/mL at 6 months) or slow virological response (>5000 copies/mL at 3 months and <1000 copies/mL at 6 months). RESULTS: Two hundred sixty five patients had VL data available at baseline and at 6 months. Virological failure was observed among 14 (5.3%) participants out of 265 patients. Twelve samples were genotyped and six had HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) mutations at baseline. Among virological failures, 9/11 (81.8%) harbored one or more HIVDR mutations at 6 months. The most frequent mutations were K103N and M184VI. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that the currently recommended first-line ART regimen is efficient in the vast majority of individuals initiating therapy in Jimma, Ethiopia eight years after the introduction of ART. However, the documented occurrence of transmitted resistance and accumulation of acquired HIVDR mutations among failing patients justify increased vigilance by improving the availability and systematic use of VL testing to monitor ART response, and underlines the need for rapid, inexpensive tests to identify the most common drug resistance mutations.</td>

      <td>Clinical assessment of peripheral neuropathy in HIV-infected children on antiretroviral therapy in rural South Africa.</td>
      <td>Peripheral neuropathy is a well-known side effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in adult patients and is particularly related to the use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. This class of drugs is included in all first-line paediatric ART regimens in Africa, but data on the prevalence of neuropathy in children are scarce. In this cross-sectional study, 182 HIV-infected children on ART in rural South Africa were assessed for peripheral neuropathy using the neuropathy symptom score (NSS) and neuropathy disability score (NDS). Peripheral neuropathy was defined as NSS >/= 5 or NDS >/= 3. Neurological assessment was completed for 174 children (96 %). Symptoms of neuropathy were reported in NSS by 48 children (28 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 21-34 %), and signs were observed in NDS in 25 children (14 %; 95 % CI 12-16 %). A diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy was established in 42 children (24 %; 95 % CI 18-30 %). Independent risk factors for peripheral neuropathy were co-trimoxazole prophylaxis (adjusted odds ratio 0.45; 95 % CI 0.21-0.95, p = 0.036) and didanosine use (adjusted odds ratio 12; 95 % CI 1.3-116, p = 0.030). CONCLUSION: Peripheral neuropathy as determined by clinical assessment is a common condition in African children on ART.</td>

      <td>Retention in care, resource utilization, and costs for adults receiving antiretroviral therapy in Zambia: a retrospective cohort study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Of the estimated 800,000 adults living with HIV in Zambia in 2011, roughly half were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). As treatment scale up continues, information on the care provided to patients after initiating ART can help guide decision-making. We estimated retention in care, the quantity of resources utilized, and costs for a retrospective cohort of adults initiating ART under routine clinical conditions in Zambia. METHODS: Data on resource utilization (antiretroviral [ARV] and non-ARV drugs, laboratory tests, outpatient clinic visits, and fixed resources) and retention in care were extracted from medical records for 846 patients who initiated ART at >/=15 years of age at six treatment sites between July 2007 and October 2008. Unit costs were estimated from the provider's perspective using site- and country-level data and are reported in 2011 USD. RESULTS: Patients initiated ART at a median CD4 cell count of 145 cells/muL. Fifty-nine percent of patients initiated on a tenofovir-containing regimen, ranging from 15% to 86% depending on site. One year after ART initiation, 75% of patients were retained in care. The average cost per patient retained in care one year after ART initiation was $243 (95% CI, $194-$293), ranging from $184 (95% CI, $172-$195) to $304 (95% CI, $290-$319) depending on site. Patients retained in care one year after ART initiation received, on average, 11.4 months' worth of ARV drugs, 1.5 CD4 tests, 1.3 blood chemistry tests, 1.4 full blood count tests, and 6.5 clinic visits with a doctor or clinical officer. At all sites, ARV drugs were the largest cost component, ranging from 38% to 84% of total costs, depending on site. CONCLUSIONS: Patients initiate ART late in the course of disease progression and a large proportion drop out of care after initiation. The quantity of resources utilized and costs vary widely by site, and patients utilize a different mix of resources under routine clinical conditions than if they were receiving fully guideline-concordant care. Improving retention in care and guideline concordance, including increasing the use of tenofovir in first-line ART regimens, may lead to increases in overall treatment costs.</td>

      <td>Incidence and predictors of herpes zoster among antiretroviral therapy-naive patients initiating HIV treatment in Johannesburg, South Africa.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics of HIV-infected patients experiencing herpes zoster after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and to describe the incidence and predictors of a herpes zoster diagnosis. METHODS: Adult patients initiating ART from April 2004 to September 2011 at the Themba Lethu Clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa were included. Patients were followed from ART initiation until the date of first herpes zoster diagnosis, or death, transfer, loss to follow-up, or dataset closure. Herpes zoster is described using incidence rates (IR) and predictors of herpes zoster are presented as subdistribution hazard ratios (sHR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Fifteen thousand and twenty-five patients were included; 62% were female, the median age was 36.6 years, and the median baseline CD4 count was 98 cells/mm(3). Three hundred and forty patients (2.3%) experienced herpes zoster in a median of 26.1 weeks after ART initiation. Most (71.5%) occurred within 1 year of initiation, for a 1-year IR of 18.1/1000 person-years. In an adjusted model, patients with low CD4 counts (<50 vs. >/=200 cells/mm(3); sHR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.21-2.47) and with a prior episode of herpes zoster (sHR: 1.53, 95% CI: 0.97-2.28) were at increased risk of incident herpes zoster. CONCLUSIONS: While only 2% of patients were diagnosed with herpes zoster in this cohort, patients with low CD4 counts and those with prior episodes of herpes zoster were at higher risk for a herpes zoster diagnosis.</td>

      <td>FACTORS INFLUENCING ADHERENCE TO ARVS AMONG PATIENTS ATTENDING COMPREHENSIVE CARE CLINIC WITHIN JOMO KENYATTA UNIVERSITY OF AGRICULTURE AND TECHNOLOGY, KIAMBU COUNTY, KENYA.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The efficacy of anti-retroviral Therapy (ART) depends on adherence to the prescribed regimen. However, lack of adherence leads to treatment failure and drug resistance among other negative outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine factors influencing adherence to ARVS among patients attending the Comprehensive Care Clinic (CCC) within Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT). DESIGN: A descriptive cross sectional study. SETTING: Comprehensive Care Clinic within JKUAT. SUBJECTS: Three hundred HIV positive patients, undergoing ART treatment and follow up at the JKUAT clinic for a minimum duration of one month before the study, were recruited. RESULTS: Of the 300 patients enrolled for the study (70% females and 30% males), 81% were adhering to ARV treatment. The factors that were significantly associated with adherence included; Support (encouragement and reminder to take drugs) (P = 0.025); the number of meals respondents took in a day (P = 0.001); pill burden (P = 0.002) and forgetfulness (P = 0.001). However, there was no significant relationship between adherence and age, marital status, education, employment status or time taken to travel to the clinic. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that, the observed level of sub-optimal adherence to ART (19%) is of public health concern. These patients are vulnerable to treatment failure and development of resistant viral strains. Consequently the modifiable factors (Support, Number of meals taken, pill burden, and forgetfulness, should be addressed to change the current tread.</td>

OBJECTIVE: To describe case detection and patient outcomes in a community-based DR-TB programme. DESIGN: DR-TB management was integrated into primary health care in Khayelitsha from 2007 onwards. Implementation was incremental, and included training and clinician support, counselling and home visits, tuberculous infection control, a local in-patient service, and routine monitoring. Patients received treatment rapidly through their local clinic, and were only hospitalised if clinically unwell. RESULTS: DR-TB case notification (any rifampicin resistance) increased from 28 per 100 000 population per year (2005-2007) to 55/100 000/year in 2009-2011 (72% HIV-infected). From 2008 to 2011, 754 patients received treatment (86% of those diagnosed). The median time between diagnostic sputum and treatment decreased over the years of implementation to 27 days in 2011 (P < 0.001).

Two-year survival was 65%, with poorer survival in those with HIV (HR 2.0, 95%CI 1.4-2.8), second-line drug resistance (HR 3.3, 95%CI 2.2-4.8), and diagnosis in earlier programme years (HR 1.4, 95%CI 1.1-2.0). CONCLUSION: Community-based DR-TB management is feasible, and contributes to improved case detection, reduced treatment delay and improved survival. Treatment outcomes remain poor, highlighting the poor efficacy, tolerability and lengthy duration of current treatment.</td>

      <td>SETTING: Public health clinics in Cape Town, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of integrated tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) service delivery on mortality, TB cure and successful treatment completion and loss to follow-up of TB-HIV co-infected patients on concurrent anti-tuberculosis and antiretroviral treatment (ART). DESIGN: A survey instrument was used to measure the degree to which TB and HIV services were jointly delivered, and patient data were collected retrospectively from clinic sites and the Department of Health. Six domains measuring integrated TB and HIV service delivery were modelled to assess their relationship with patient outcomes. RESULTS: Two domains, integrated TB and ART service delivery and the delivery of TB and HIV care by one clinical team, were associated with lowered odds of death. Care by the same clinical team was also associated with reduced loss to follow-up. CONCLUSION: Overall, these findings show that the organization and delivery of health services are important factors that influence health outcomes. These findings strongly support efforts by local governments to integrate TB and ART services, and may help to alleviate concerns that restructuring of TB programs could have a negative impact on long-standing gains.</td>

      <td>Early infant diagnosis of HIV and fast initiation of anti-retroviral therapy in a rural African setting: how well are we doing?</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In South Africa, current estimates indicate that 1% of infants will be HIV PCR-positive by 2 months of age. WHO recommends early infant diagnosis (EID) and immediate initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in infants who are diagnosed with HIV infection within the first year of life. AIMS: To investigate rates of EID and subsequent ART initiation in infants attending the Primary Health Care (PHC) clinics which fed Mseleni Hospital during 2012. OBJECTIVES: To measure the number of infants (<1 year of age) testing HIV PCR-positive who are currently collecting ART and those lost to follow-up. METHODS: HIV PCR test results from Mseleni Hospital in 2012 were cross-referenced with the national database (TIER.net) for ART initiation and follow-up from the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) database. RESULTS: 455 of 843 (54%) HIV-exposed infants (<2 months) were tested by HIV PCR, 11 of whom (2.4%) tested positive, reflecting the national prevalence. Of 897 HIV PCR tests undertaken in infants <1 year, 51 (5.7%) were positive, and 36 were included for analysis. Only 13 (36.1%) of these infants are currently collecting ART; seven (19.4%) commenced ART but were lost to follow-up, and 16 (44.5%) never started ART. CONCLUSION: 16 (44.5%) HIV PCR-positive infants in Mseleni Hospital and its feeder PHCs were not commenced on ART. This may reflect a similar problem in other rural hospitals in South Africa. Specific interventions are required to rapidly up-scale early initiation of ART in this vulnerable group of infants.</td>

      <td>Patients who return to care after tracking remain at high risk of attrition: experience from a large HIV clinic, Uganda.</td>
      <td>We determined the retention rate of patients infected with HIV who resumed care after being tracked at the Infectious Diseases Clinic (IDC) in Kampala, Uganda. Between April 2011 and September 2013, patients who missed their clinic appointment for 8-90 days were tracked, and those who returned to the clinic within 120 days were followed up. The proportion of patients retained among tracked patients, and those who resumed care before tracking started was compared. At 18 months of follow up, 33 (39%) of the tracked patients and 72 (61%) of those who had resumed care before tracking started were retained in care. The most important cause of attrition among the traceable was self-transfer to another clinic (38 [73%] patients), whereas among those who resumed care before tracking was loss to follow up (LTFU) (32 [71%] patients). Tracked patients who resume care following a missed appointment are at high risk of attrition. To increase retention, antiretroviral therapy clinics need to adopt a chronic care model which takes into consideration patients' changing needs and their preference for self-management.</td>

      <td>Linking women who test HIV-positive in pregnancy-related services to HIV care and treatment services in Kenya: a mixed methods prospective cohort study.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: There has been insufficient attention to long-term care and treatment for pregnant women diagnosed with HIV. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study of 100 HIV-positive women recruited within pregnancy-related services in a district hospital in Kenya employed quantitative methods to assess attrition between women testing HIV-positive in pregnancy-related services and accessing long-term HIV care and treatment services. Qualitative methods were used to explore barriers and facilitators to navigating these services. Structured questionnaires were administered to cohort participants at enrolment and 90+ days later. Participants' medical records were monitored prospectively. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were carried out with a sub-set of 19 participants. FINDINGS: Only 53/100 (53%) women registered at an HIV clinic within 90 days of HIV diagnosis, of whom 27/53 (51%) had a CD4 count result in their file. 11/27 (41%) women were eligible for immediate antiretroviral therapy (ART); only 6/11 (55%) started ART during study follow-up. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, factors associated with registration at the HIV clinic within 90 days of HIV diagnosis were: having cared for someone with HIV (aOR:3.67(95%CI:1.22, 11.09)), not having to pay for transport to the hospital (aOR:2.73(95%CI:1.09, 6.84)), and having received enough information to decide to have an HIV test (aOR:3.61(95%CI:0.83, 15.71)). Qualitative data revealed multiple factors underlying high patient drop-out related to women's social support networks (e.g. partner's attitude to HIV status), interactions with health workers (e.g. being given unclear/incorrect HIV-related information) and health services characteristics (e.g. restricted opening hours, long waiting times). CONCLUSION: HIV testing within pregnancy-related services is an important entry point to HIV care and treatment services, but few women successfully completed the steps needed for assessment of their treatment needs within three months of diagnosis. Programmatic recommendations include simplified pathways to care, better-tailored counselling, integration of ART into antenatal services, and facilitation of social support.</td>

      <td>Factors associated with pruritic papular eruption of human immunodeficiency virus infection in the antiretroviral therapy era.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Pruritic papular eruption (PPE) of HIV is common in HIV-infected populations living in the tropics. Its aetiology has been attributed to insect bite reactions and it is reported to improve with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Its presence after at least 6 months of ART has been proposed as one of several markers of treatment failure. OBJECTIVES: To determine factors associated with PPE in HIV-infected persons receiving ART. METHODS: A case-control study nested within a 500-person cohort from a teaching hospital in Mbarara, Uganda. Forty-five cases and 90 controls were enrolled. Cases had received ART for >/= 15 months and had an itchy papular rash for at least 1 month with microscopic correlation by skin biopsy. Each case was individually matched with two controls for age, sex and ART duration. RESULTS: Twenty-five of 45 cases (56%) had microscopic findings consistent with PPE. At skin examination and biopsy (study enrolment), a similar proportion of PPE cases and matched controls had plasma HIV RNA < 400 copies mL(-1) (96% vs. 85%, P = 0.31). The odds of having PPE increased fourfold with every log increase in viral load at ART initiation (P = 0.02) but not at study enrolment. CD4 counts at ART initiation and study enrolment, and CD4 gains and CD8(+) T-cell activation measured 6 and 12 months after ART commencement were not associated with PPE. Study participants who reported daily insect bites had greater odds of being cases [odds ratio (OR) 8.3, P < 0.001] or PPE cases (OR 8.6, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Pruritic papular eruption in HIV-infected persons receiving ART for >/= 15 months was associated with greater HIV viraemia at ART commencement, independent of CD4 count. Skin biopsies are important to distinguish between PPE and other itchy papular eruptions.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVES: We investigated phenotypic and genotypic resistance after 2 years of first-line therapy with two HIV treatment regimens in the absence of virological monitoring. METHODS: NORA [Nevirapine OR Abacavir study, a sub-study of the Development of AntiRetroviral Therapy in Africa (DART) trial] randomized 600 symptomatic HIV-infected Ugandan adults (CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm(3)) to receive zidovudine/lamivudine plus abacavir (cABC arm) or nevirapine (cNVP arm). All virological tests were performed retrospectively, including resistance tests on week 96 plasma samples with HIV RNA levels >/=1000 copies/mL. Phenotypic resistance was expressed as fold-change in IC(50) (FC) relative to wild-type virus. RESULTS: HIV-1 RNA viral load >/=1000 copies/mL at week 96 was seen in 58/204 (28.4%) cABC participants and 21/159 (13.2%) cNVP participants. Resistance results were available in 35 cABC and 17 cNVP participants; 31 (89%) cABC and 16 (94%) cNVP isolates had a week 96 FC below the biological cut-off for tenofovir (2.2). In the cNVP arm, 16/17 participants had resistance mutations synonymous with high-level resistance to nevirapine and efavirenz; FC values for etravirine were above the biological cut-off in 9 (53%) isolates. In multivariate regression models, K65R, Y115F and the presence of thymidine analogue-associated mutations were associated with increased susceptibility to etravirine in the cABC arm. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the use of tenofovir following failure of a first-line zidovudine-containing regimen and shed further light on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor hypersusceptibility.</td>

      <td>Antibacterial resistance in sub-Saharan Africa: an underestimated emergency.</td>
      <td>Antibacterial resistance-associated infections are known to increase morbidity, mortality, and cost of treatment, and to potentially put others in the community at higher risk of infections. In high-income countries, where the burden of infectious diseases is relatively modest, resistance to first-line antibacterial agents is usually overcome by use of second- and third-line agents. However, in developing countries where the burden of infectious diseases is high, patients with antibacterial-resistant infections may be unable to obtain or afford effective second-line treatments. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the situation is aggravated by poor hygiene, unreliable water supplies, civil conflicts, and increasing numbers of immunocompromised people, such as those with HIV, which facilitate both the evolution of resistant pathogens and their rapid spread in the community. Because of limited capacity for disease detection and surveillance, the burden of illnesses due to treatable bacterial infections, their specific etiologies, and the awareness of antibacterial resistance are less well established in most of SSA, and therefore the ability to mitigate their consequences is significantly limited.</td>

      <td>Treatment outcomes of new tuberculosis patients hospitalized in Kampala, Uganda: a prospective cohort study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In most resource limited settings, new tuberculosis (TB) patients are usually treated as outpatients. We sought to investigate the reasons for hospitalisation and the predictors of poor treatment outcomes and mortality in a cohort of hospitalized new TB patients in Kampala, Uganda. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Ninety-six new TB patients hospitalised between 2003 and 2006 were enrolled and followed for two years. Thirty two were HIV-uninfected and 64 were HIV-infected. Among the HIV-uninfected, the commonest reasons for hospitalization were low Karnofsky score (47%) and need for diagnostic evaluation (25%). HIV-infected patients were commonly hospitalized due to low Karnofsky score (72%), concurrent illness (16%) and diagnostic evaluation (14%). Eleven HIV uninfected patients died (mortality rate 19.7 per 100 person-years) while 41 deaths occurred among the HIV-infected patients (mortality rate 46.9 per 100 person years). In all patients an unsuccessful treatment outcome (treatment failure, death during the treatment period or an unknown outcome) was associated with duration of TB symptoms, with the odds of an unsuccessful outcome decreasing with increasing duration. Among HIV-infected patients, an unsuccessful treatment outcome was also associated with male sex (P = 0.004) and age (P = 0.034). Low Karnofsky score (aHR = 8.93, 95% CI 1.88 - 42.40, P = 0.001) was the only factor significantly associated with mortality among the HIV-uninfected. Mortality among the HIV-infected was associated with the composite variable of CD4 and ART use, with patients with baseline CD4 below 200 cells/microL who were not on ART at a greater risk of death than those who were on ART, and low Karnofsky score (aHR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.02 - 4.01, P = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Poor health status is a common cause of hospitalisation for new TB patients. Mortality in this study was very high and associated with advanced HIV Disease and no use of ART.</td>

      <td>Implementing antiretroviral resistance testing in a primary health care HIV treatment programme in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: early experiences, achievements and challenges.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral drug resistance is becoming increasingly common with the expansion of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment programmes in high prevalence settings. Genotypic resistance testing could have benefit in guiding individual-level treatment decisions but successful models for delivering resistance testing in low- and middle-income countries have not been reported. METHODS: An HIV Treatment Failure Clinic model was implemented within a large primary health care HIV treatment programme in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Genotypic resistance testing was offered to adults (>/=16 years) with virological failure on first-line antiretroviral therapy (one viral load >1000 copies/ml after at least 12 months on a standard first-line regimen). A genotypic resistance test report was generated with treatment recommendations from a specialist HIV clinician and sent to medical officers at the clinics who were responsible for patient management. A quantitative process evaluation was conducted to determine how the model was implemented and to provide feedback regarding barriers and challenges to delivery. RESULTS: A total of 508 specimens were submitted for genotyping between 8 April 2011 and 31 January 2013; in 438 cases (86.2%) a complete genotype report with recommendations from the specialist clinician was sent to the medical officer. The median turnaround time from specimen collection to receipt of final report was 18 days (interquartile range (IQR) 13-29). In 114 (26.0%) cases the recommended treatment differed from what would be given in the absence of drug resistance testing. In the majority of cases (n = 315, 71.9%), the subsequent treatment prescribed was in line with the recommendations of the report. CONCLUSIONS: Genotypic resistance testing was successfully implemented in this large primary health care HIV programme and the system functioned well enough for the results to influence clinical management decisions in real time. Further research will explore the impact and cost-effectiveness of different implementation models in different settings.</td>

      <td>The association between self-reported stigma and loss-to-follow up in treatment eligible HIV positive adults in rural Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The relationship between loss-to-follow-up (LTFU) in HIV treatment and care programmes and psychosocial factors, including self-reported stigma, is important to understand. This prospective cohort study explored stigma and LTFU in treatment eligible adults who had yet not started antiretroviral therapy (ART). METHODS: Psychosocial, clinical and demographic data were collected at a baseline interview. Self-reported stigma was measured with a multi-item scale. LTFU was defined as not attending clinic in the 90 days since last appointment or before death. Data was collected between January 2009 and January 2013 and analysed using Cox Regression. RESULTS: 380 individuals were recruited (median time in study 3.35 years, total time at risk 1065.81 person-years). 203 were retained (53.4%), 109 were LTFU (28.7%), 48 had died and were not LTFU at death (12.6%) and 20 had transferred out (5.3%). The LTFU rate was 10.65 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 8.48-12.34). 362 individuals (95.3%) started ART. Stigma total score (categorised in quartiles) was not significantly associated with LTFU in either univariable or multivariable analysis (adjusting for other variables in the final model): second quartile aHR 0.77 (95%CI: 0.41-1.46), third quartile aHR 1.20(95%CI: 0.721-2.04), fourth quartile aHR 0.62 (95%CI: 0.35-1.11). In the final multivariable model, higher LTFU rates were associated with male gender, increased openness with friends/family and believing that community problems would be solved at higher levels. Lower LTFU rates were independently associated with increased year of age, greater reliance on family/friends, and having children. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic and other psychosocial factors were more closely related to LTFU than self-reported stigma. This may be consistent with high levels of social exposure to HIV and ART and with stigma affecting LTFU less than other stages of care. Research and clinical implications are discussed.</td>

      <td>Impact of geographic and transportation-related barriers on HIV outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review.</td>
      <td>Difficulty obtaining reliable transportation to clinic is frequently cited as a barrier to HIV care in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Numerous studies have sought to characterize the impact of geographic and transportation-related barriers on HIV outcomes in SSA, but to date there has been no systematic attempt to summarize these findings. In this systematic review, we summarized this body of literature. We searched for studies conducted in SSA examining the following outcomes in the HIV care continuum: (1) voluntary counseling and testing, (2) pre-antiretroviral therapy (ART) linkage to care, (3) loss to follow-up and mortality, and (4) ART adherence and/or viral suppression. We identified 34 studies containing 52 unique estimates of association between a geographic or transportation-related barrier and an HIV outcome. There was an inverse effect in 23 estimates (44 %), a null association in 26 (50 %), and a paradoxical beneficial impact in 3 (6 %). We conclude that geographic and transportation-related barriers are associated with poor outcomes across the continuum of HIV care.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: The HVTN 503/Phambili study, which assessed the efficacy of the Merck Ad5 gag/pol/nef subtype B HIV-1 preventive vaccine in South Africa, was stopped when futility criteria in the Step study (assessing the same vaccine in the Americas, Caribbean, and Australia) were met. Here we report long-term follow-up data. METHODS: HVTN 503/Phambili was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial that recruited HIV-1 uninfected, sexually active adults aged 18-35 years from five sites in South Africa. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by computer-generated random numbers to either vaccine or placebo, stratified by site and sex. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate HIV-1 infection in the modified intention-to-treat cohort, all of whom were unmasked early in follow-up. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00413725 and the South African National Health Research Database, number DOH-27-0207-1539. FINDINGS: Between Jan 24, 2007, and Sept 19, 2007, 801 participants (26.7%) of a planned 3000 were randomly assigned (400 to vaccine, 401 to placebo); 216 (27%) received only one injection, 529 (66%) received only two injections, and 56 (7%) received three injections. At a median follow-up of 42 months (IQR 31-42), 63 vaccine recipients (16%) had HIV-1 infection compared with 37 placebo recipients (9%; adjusted HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.13-2.55; p=0.01). Risk for HIV-1 infection did not differ according to the number of vaccinations received, sex, circumcision, or adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) serostatus. Differences in risk behaviour at baseline or during the study, or annualised dropout rate (7.7% [95% CI 6.2-9.5] for vaccine recipients vs 8.8% [7.1-10.7] for placebo recipients; p=0.40) are unlikely explanations for the increased rate of HIV-1 infections seen in vaccine recipients. INTERPRETATION: The increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition in vaccine recipients, irrespective of number of doses received, warrants further investigation to understand the biological mechanism. We caution against further use of the Ad5 vector for HIV vaccines. FUNDING: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Merck, and South African Medical Research Council.</td>

      <td>Challenges and opportunities for implementing integrated mental health care: a district level situation analysis from five low- and middle-income countries.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Little is known about how to tailor implementation of mental health services in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to the diverse settings encountered within and between countries. In this paper we compare the baseline context, challenges and opportunities in districts in five LMICs (Ethiopia, India, Nepal, South Africa and Uganda) participating in the PRogramme for Improving Mental health carE (PRIME). The purpose was to inform development and implementation of a comprehensive district plan to integrate mental health into primary care. METHODS: A situation analysis tool was developed for the study, drawing on existing tools and expert consensus. Cross-sectional information obtained was largely in the public domain in all five districts. RESULTS: The PRIME study districts face substantial contextual and health system challenges many of which are common across sites. Reliable information on existing treatment coverage for mental disorders was unavailable. Particularly in the low-income countries, many health service organisational requirements for mental health care were absent, including specialist mental health professionals to support the service and reliable supplies of medication. Across all sites, community mental health literacy was low and there were no models of multi-sectoral working or collaborations with traditional or religious healers. Nonetheless health system opportunities were apparent. In each district there was potential to apply existing models of care for tuberculosis and HIV or non-communicable disorders, which have established mechanisms for detection of drop-out from care, outreach and adherence support. The extensive networks of community-based health workers and volunteers in most districts provide further opportunities to expand mental health care. CONCLUSIONS: The low level of baseline health system preparedness across sites underlines that interventions at the levels of health care organisation, health facility and community will all be essential for sustainable delivery of quality mental health care integrated into primary care.</td>

      <td>The 2011 prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among pregnant women in Botswana was 30.4%. High coverage rates of HIV testing and antiretroviral prophylaxis have reduced the rate of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Botswana from as high as 40% with no prophylaxis to <4% in 2011. In June 2005, the national Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) Program began testing HIV-exposed infants (i.e., those born to HIV-infected mothers) for HIV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at 6 weeks postpartum. During 2005-2012, follow-up of all HIV-infected infants diagnosed in all 13 postnatal care facilities in Francistown, Botswana, was conducted to ascertain patient outcomes. A total of 202 infants were diagnosed with HIV. As of September 2013, 82 (41%) children were alive and on antiretroviral therapy (ART), 79 (39%) had died, and 41 (20%) were either lost to follow-up, had transferred, or their mothers declined ART. Despite success in preventing mother-to-child transmission in Botswana, results of the EID program highlight the need for early diagnosis of HIV-infected infants, prompt initiation of ART, and retention in care.</td>

      <td>cART prescription trends in a prospective HIV cohort in rural Tanzania from 2007 to 2011.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Since 2010, World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines discourage using stavudine in first-line regimens due to frequent and severe side effects. This study describes the implementation of this recommendation and trends in usage of antiretroviral therapy combinations in a cohort of HIV-positive patients in rural Tanzania. METHODS: We analyzed longitudinal, prospectively collected clinical data of HIV-1 infected adults initiating antiretroviral therapy within the Kilombero Ulanga Antiretroviral Cohort (KIULARCO) in Ifakara, Tanzania from 2007-2011. RESULTS: This analysis included data of 3008 patients. Median age was 38 (interquartile range [IQR] 31-45) years, 1962 (65.2%) of all subjects were female, and median CD4+ cell count at enrollment was 168 cells/mm3 (IQR 81-273). The percentage of prescriptions containing stavudine in initial regimens fell from a maximum of 75.3% in 2008 to 10.7% in 2011. TDF/FTC/EFV became available in 2009 and was used in 41.9% of patients initiating cART in 2011. An overall on-treatment analysis revealed that d4T/3TC/NVP and AZT/3TC/EFV were the most prescribed combinations in each year, including 2011 (674 [36.5%] and 641 [34.7%] patients, respectively). Of those receiving stavudine in 2011, 659 (89.1%) initiated it before 2011. CONCLUSIONS: Initial cART with stavudine declined to low levels according to recommendations but the overall use of stavudine remained substantial, as individuals already on cART containing stavudine were not changed to alternative drugs. Our findings highlight the critical need to exchange stavudine in treatment regimens of patients who initiated therapy in earlier years.</td>

      <td>Sex differences in responses to antiretroviral treatment in South African HIV-infected children on ritonavir-boosted lopinavir- and nevirapine-based treatment.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: While studies of HIV-infected adults on antiretroviral treatment (ART) report no sex differences in immune recovery and virologic response but more ART-associated complications in women, sex differences in disease progression and response to ART among children have not been well assessed. The objective of this study was to evaluate for sex differences in response to ART in South African HIV-infected children who were randomized to continue ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r)-based ART or switch to nevirapine-based ART. METHODS: ART outcomes in HIV-infected boys and girls in Johannesburg, South Africa from 2005-2010 were compared. Children initiated ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r)-based ART before 24 months of age and were randomized to remain on LPV/r or switch to nevirapine-based ART after achieving viral suppression. Children were followed for 76 weeks post-randomization and then long-term follow up continued for a minimum of 99 weeks and maximum of 245 weeks after randomization. Viral load, CD4 count, lipids, anthropometrics, drug concentrations, and adherence were measured at regular intervals. Outcomes were compared between sexes within treatment strata. RESULTS: A total of 323 children (median age 8.8 months, IQR 5.1-13.5), including 168 boys and 155 girls, initiated LPV/r-based ART and 195 children were randomized. No sex differences in risk of virological failure (confirmed viral load >1000 copies/mL) by 156 weeks post-randomization were observed within either treatment group. Girls switched to nevirapine had more robust CD4 count improvement relative to boys in this group through 112 weeks post-randomization. In addition, girls remaining on LPV/r had higher plasma concentrations of ritonavir than boys during post-randomization visits. After a mean of 3.4 years post-randomization, girls remaining on LPV/r also had a higher total cholesterol:HDL ratio and lower mean HDL than boys on LPV/r. CONCLUSIONS: Sex differences are noted in treated HIV-infected children even at a young age, and appear to depend on treatment regimen. Future studies are warranted to determine biological mechanisms and clinical significance of these differences. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00117728.</td>

      <td>Decentralization of HIV care is promoted to improve access to antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa. This study describes care transitions among HIV-infected persons in Northern Tanzania during a period of rapid decentralization of HIV care and treatment centers (CTCs) from hospitals to local health centers. Between November 2008 and June 2009, 492 HIV-infected patients in established care at two referral hospitals in Moshi, Tanzania, and 262 persons newly diagnosed with HIV were selected for participation in a prospective cohort study entitled Coping with HIV/AIDS in Tanzania. Clinical records and participant self-reports, collected between June and November 2012, were used to describe retention in care and transitions between CTCs during the study period. After a mean follow-up period of 3.5 years, 10% of participants had died, 9% were lost to follow-up, and 11% had moved. Of the remaining participants enrolled from CTCs, more than 90% reported at least one CTC visit during the previous six months, with 98% still in care at the CTC at which they were enrolled. Nearly three out of four newly diagnosed clients listed a referral hospital as their primary CTC. Fewer than 10% of participants ever sought care at another CTC in the study area; nearly 90% of those in care bypassed their closest CTC. Administrative data from all facilities in the study area indicate that new clients, even after the scale-up from 8 CTCs in 2006 to 21 CTCs in 2008, disproportionately selected established CTCs, and client volume at newly approved facilities was highly variable. Despite the decentralization of HIV care and treatment in this setting, many patients continue to bypass their closest CTC to seek care at established facilities. Patient preferences for decentralized HIV care, which may inform optimal resource utilization, are largely unknown and warrant further investigation.</td>

      <td>Association between nutritional status and the immune response in HIV + patients under HAART: protocol for a systematic review.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Over 850 million people worldwide and 200 million adults in Sub-Saharan Africa suffer from malnutrition. Countries most affected by HIV are also stricken by elevated rates of food insecurity and malnutrition. HIV infection and insufficient nutritional intake are part of a vicious cycle that contributes to immunodeficiency and negative health outcomes. However, the effect of the overlap between HIV infection and undernutrition on the immune response following antiretroviral initiation remains unclear. A possible explanation could be the lack of consensus concerning the definition and assessment of nutritional status. Our objectives are to investigate the existence of an association between undernutrition and immune response at antiretroviral treatment initiation and the following year in low- and middle-income countries where malnutrition is most prevalent. METHODS/DESIGN: Our systematic review will identify studies originating from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) published from 1996 onwards, through searches in MEDLINE (PubMed interface), EMBASE (OVID interface), Cochrane Central (OVID interface) and grey literature. No language restrictions will be applied. We will seek out studies of any design investigating the association between the nutritional status (for example, undernourished versus well nourished) and the immune response, either in terms of CD4 count or immune failure, in seropositive patients initiating antiretroviral therapy or in their first year of treatment. Two reviewers will independently screen articles, extract data and assess scientific quality using standardized forms and published quality assessment tools tailored for each study design. Where feasible, pooled measures of association will be obtained through meta-analyses. Results will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement. This protocol has been registered in the PROSPERO database (registration number: CRD42014005961). CONCLUSION: Undernutrition and weight loss are prevalent amongst highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-treated patients in LMICs and contribute to excess early mortality. A possible intermediate pathway could be poor immune reconstitution secondary to deficient nutritional status. In the face of limited access to second line treatments, raising HIV resistance and cut backs to HIV programs, it is crucial to identify the factors associated with suboptimal response and therapeutic failure in order to better customize the care strategies employed in LMICs.</td>

      <td>Substantial amounts of data have been generated from patient management and academic exercises designed to better understand the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic and design interventions to control it. A number of specialized databases have been designed to manage huge data sets from HIV cohort, vaccine, host genomic and drug resistance studies. Besides databases from cohort studies, most of the online databases contain limited curated data and are thus sequence repositories. HIV drug resistance has been shown to have a great potential to derail the progress made thus far through antiretroviral therapy. Thus, a lot of resources have been invested in generating drug resistance data for patient management and surveillance purposes. Unfortunately, most of the data currently available relate to subtype B even though >60% of the epidemic is caused by HIV-1 subtype C. A consortium of clinicians, scientists, public health experts and policy markers working in southern Africa came together and formed a network, the Southern African Treatment and Resistance Network (SATuRN), with the aim of increasing curated HIV-1 subtype C and tuberculosis drug resistance data. This article describes the HIV-1 data curation process using the SATuRN Rega database. The data curation is a manual and time-consuming process done by clinical, laboratory and data curation specialists. Access to the highly curated data sets is through applications that are reviewed by the SATuRN executive committee. Examples of research outputs from the analysis of the curated data include trends in the level of transmitted drug resistance in South Africa, analysis of the levels of acquired resistance among patients failing therapy and factors associated with the absence of genotypic evidence of drug resistance among patients failing therapy. All these studies have been important for informing first- and second-line therapy. This database is a free password-protected open source database available on www.bioafrica.net.

      <td>Remarkably little is known about associations between age at menarche and sexually transmitted infections, although girls with earlier menarche tend to have earlier sexual debut and school drop-out, so an association might be expected. In a population-based survey of >3000 women aged 15-30 in northern Malawi we show that those with earlier menarche had earlier sexual debut, earlier marriage and were more often Herpes simplex type-2 (HSV-2) positive. Compared to those with menarche aged <14, the age-adjusted odds ratios for HSV-2 were 0.89 (95%CI 0.71-1.1), 0.71 (0.57-0.89) and 0.69 (0.54-0.89) for menarche aged 14, 15 and 16+ respectively. This association persisted after adjusting for socio-economic factors, including schooling, and for sexual behaviour. No such association was seen with HIV infection, which is much less common and less uniformly distributed than HSV-2 in this population. The extra vulnerability of girls with earlier menarche needs to be recognised. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01604.001.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: To explore the levels and determinants of loss to follow-up (LTF) under universal lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for pregnant and breastfeeding women ('Option B+') in Malawi. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We examined retention in care, from the date of ART initiation up to 6 months, for women in the Option B+ program. We analysed nationwide facility-level data on women who started ART at 540 facilities (n = 21,939), as well as individual-level data on patients who started ART at 19 large facilities (n = 11,534). RESULTS: Of the women who started ART under Option B+ (n = 21,939), 17% appeared to be lost to follow-up 6 months after ART initiation. Most losses occurred in the first 3 months of therapy. Option B+ patients who started therapy during pregnancy were five times more likely than women who started ART in WHO stage 3/4 or with a CD4 cell count 350 cells/mul or less, to never return after their initial clinic visit [odds ratio (OR) 5.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.2-6.1]. Option B+ patients who started therapy while breastfeeding were twice as likely to miss their first follow-up visit (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.8-2.8). LTF was highest in pregnant Option B+ patients who began ART at large clinics on the day they were diagnosed with HIV. LTF varied considerably between facilities, ranging from 0 to 58%. CONCLUSION: Decreasing LTF will improve the effectiveness of the Option B+ approach. Tailored interventions, like community or family-based models of care could improve its effectiveness.</td>

      <td>How do different eligibility guidelines for antiretroviral therapy affect the cost-effectiveness of routine viral load testing in sub-Saharan Africa?</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Increased eligibility guidelines of antiretroviral therapy (ART) may lead to greater routine viral load monitoring. However, in resource-constrained settings, the additional resources required by greater routine viral load monitoring may impair ability to comply with expanded eligibility guidelines for ART. OBJECTIVE: We use a published validated computer simulation of the HIV epidemic in East African countries (expanded to include transmission as well as disease progression) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of routine viral load monitoring. METHODS: We explored alternative scenarios regarding cost, frequency, and switching threshold of routine viral load monitoring (including every 6 or every 12 months; and switching thresholds of 1000, or 10 000 copies/ml), as well as alternative scenarios regarding ART initiation (200, 350, 500 cells/mul, and no CD4 cell threshold). For each ART initiation strategy, we sought to identify the viral load monitoring strategy at which the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of more frequent routine viral load testing became more favorable than the ICER of more expansive ART eligibility. Cost inputs were based on data provided by the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH), and disease progression inputs were based on prior published work. We used a discount rate of 3%, a time horizon of 20 years, and a payer perspective. RESULTS: Across a wide range of scenarios, and even when considering the beneficial effect of virological monitoring at reducing HIV transmission, earlier ART initiation conferred far greater health benefits for resources spent than routine virological testing, with ICERs of approximately $1000 to $2000 for earlier ART initiation, versus ICERs of approximately $5000 to $25 000 for routine virological monitoring. ICERs of viral load testing were insensitive to the cost of the viral load test, because most of the costs originated from the downstream higher costs of later regimens. ICERs of viral load testing were very sensitive to the relative cost of second-line compared with first-line regimens, assuming favorable value when the costs of these regimens were equal. CONCLUSION: If all HIV patients are not yet treated with ART starting at 500 cells/mul and costs of second regimens remain substantially more expensive than first-line regimens, resources would buy more population health if they are spent on earlier ART rather than being spent on routine virological testing.</td>

      <td>Dropout and re-enrollment: implications for epidemiological projections of treatment programs.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: EMOD-HIV v0.8 has been used to estimate the potential impact of expanding treatment guidelines to allow earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa with current or improved treatment coverage. In generating these results, a model must additionally make assumptions about the rates of dropout and re-initiation into ART programs before and after the program change, about which little is known. The objective of this work is to rigorously analyze modeling assumptions and the sensitivity of model results with respect to relevant mechanisms and parameters. METHODS: We varied key model assumptions pertaining to ART dropout and re-enrollment to analyze their effect on the cost, impact, and cost-effectiveness of expanding treatment guidelines, and of expanding coverage via improved testing and linkage to care. Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis of 17 relevant model parameters. SETTING: South Africa. RESULTS: Allowing re-initiation of ART irrespective of prior treatment doubled the cost and impact of expanding treatment guidelines, as compared with a scenario in which re-initiation could only be triggered by a health event (AIDS symptoms, diagnosis of a partner, or an antenatal care visit). Increasing the probability of 'voluntary' re-initiation (not triggered by a health event) was the most cost-effective way to improve the treatment program, especially in the short term because it provided immediate benefits to those who would otherwise have delayed re-initiation until the onset of AIDS symptoms. However, the maximum impact of this change was limited compared with expanding coverage through improvements in testing and linkage to care. Beyond improvements in coverage and re-initiation, further gains could be made by improving retention in care. Only with optimal retention in care was expansion of guidelines cost-saving after 20 years due to reductions in transmission. Re-initiation did not reduce transmission sufficiently to make a guideline change cost-effective due to transmission that occurred while patients were away from care. Sensitivity analysis suggested that enormous health benefits could be attained by improving treatment regimens to have higher efficacy at preventing transmission, increasing the proportion of the population with access to improved healthcare, and reducing 'leaks' in the 'cascade of care.' Increasing the proportion of individuals who receive CD4 cell results was particularly cost-effective at baseline levels of coverage, and increasing retention on ART was particularly cost-effective with expanded coverage. CONCLUSION: This analysis provides a sense of the magnitude of uncertainty in program cost and impact that policy-makers could anticipate in the face of uncertain future programmatic changes. Our findings suggest that increasing re-initiation is the most cost-effective means of initial program improvement, especially in the short term, but that improvements in retention are necessary in order to reap the full transmission-blocking benefits of a test-and-treat program in the long term.</td>

      <td>Modeling the impact of early antiretroviral therapy for adults coinfected with HIV and hepatitis B or C in South Africa.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: There has been discussion about whether individuals coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) ( approximately 30% of all people living with HIV) should be prioritized for early HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART). We assess the relative benefits of providing ART at CD4 count below 500 cells/mul or immediate ART to HCV/HIV or HBV/HIV-coinfected adults compared with HIV-monoinfected adults. We evaluate individual outcomes (HIV/liver disease progression) and preventive benefits in a generalized HIV epidemic setting. METHODS: We modeled disease progression for HIV-monoinfected, HBV/HIV-coinfected, and HCV/HIV-coinfected adults for differing ART eligibility thresholds (CD4 <350 cells/mul, CD4 <500 cells/mul, immediate ART eligibility upon infection). We report disability-adjusted life-years averted per 100 person-years on ART (DALYaverted/100PYonART) as a measure of the health benefits generated from incremental changes in ART eligibility. Sensitivity analyses explored impact on sexual HIV and vertical HIV, HCV, and HBV transmission. RESULTS: For HBV/HIV-coinfected adults, a switch to ART initiation at CD4 count below 500 cells/mul from CD4 below 350 cells/mul generates 9% greater health benefits per year on ART (48 DALYaverted/100PYonART) than for HIV-monoinfected adults (44 DALYaverted/100PYonART). Additionally, ART at CD4 below 500 cells/mul could prevent 25% and 32% of vertical transmissions of HIV and HBV, respectively. For HCV/HIV-coinfected adults, ART at CD4 below 500 cells/mul generates 10% fewer health benefits (40 DALYaverted/100PYonART) than for HIV monoinfection, unless ART reduces progression to cirrhosis by more than 70% (33% in base-case). CONCLUSIONS: The additional therapeutic benefits of ART for HBV-related liver disease results in ART generating more health benefits among HBV/HIV-coinfected adults than HIV-monoinfected individuals, whereas less health benefits are generated amongst HCV/HIV coinfection in a generalized HIV epidemic setting.</td>

      <td>Treatment of Kaposi sarcoma in children with HIV-1 infection.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Kaposi sarcoma (KS) remains the second most frequently diagnosed HIV-related malignancy (HRM) worldwide and most common HRM in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV is most prevalent and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), the precipitating agent for the development of KS, is endemic. The majority of KS patients would likely benefit from systemic chemotherapy in addition to the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, as paediatric staging and treatment criteria are not readily available, there are no uniform treatment criteria. OBJECTIVES: To describe the efficacy and effectiveness of current treatment options for HIV-associated KS in ART-treated paediatric populations. SEARCH METHODS: We used standard Cochrane methods to search electronic databases and conference proceedings with relevant search terms without limits to language. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies of HIV-infected infants and children <18 years old treated with ART and diagnosed with KS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Abstracts of all studies identified by electronic or bibliographic scanning were examined independently by two authors. We initially identified 920 references and examined 15 in detail for study eligibility. Data were abstracted independently using a standardised abstraction form. MAIN RESULTS: After initially screening 920 titles, 15 full-text articles were closely examined by two authors. We identified four cohort studies that met our inclusion criteria for data extraction, coding, and potential meta-analysis.Using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane risk of bias assessments, all observational studies had cohorts that were representative of average (treated and untreated) HIV-infected children with Kaposi sarcoma. For all outcomes of interest, no study adjusted for any other potential confounders. Two of four observational studies either explicitly described complete follow up of the study participants and/or described the characteristics of the participants lost to follow up.The use of ART together with a chemotherapeutic regimen versus ART alone appears to increase the likelihood of KS remission in HIV-infected children diagnosed with KS, although data are sparse and not adequately adjusted for staging of disease and comorbidities. Additionally, though data are sparse, the use of ART together with a chemotherapeutic regimen versus chemotherapy alone in some analyses appears to increase the likelihood of KS remission and reduce the risk of death in HIV-infected children diagnosed with KS.In this analysis, we found that the quality of evidence was very low due to small sample sizes and a paucity of paediatric literature. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Data describing the efficacy of different treatment options for pediatric KS, to include chemotherapy and ART, are sparse. However, the use of ART together with a chemotherapy regimen may be superior to the use of ART alone or of chemotherapy alone.</td>

      <td>INTRODUCTION: Gender differences in antiretroviral therapy (ART) outcomes are critical in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed the association between gender and virologic failure among adult patients treated in a public routine clinic (one of the largest in West Africa) in Burkina Faso. METHODS: We performed a case-control study between July and October 2012 among patients who had received ART at the Bobo Dioulasso Day Care Unit. Patients were eligible if they were 15 years or older, positive for HIV-1 or HIV-1+2, and on first-line ART for at least six months. Cases were all patients with two consecutive HIV loads >1000 copies/mL (Biocentric Generic or Abbott Real Time assays), or one HIV load >1000 copies/mL associated with immunologic or clinical failure criteria. Controls were all patients who only had HIV loads <300 copies/mL. The association between gender and virologic failure was assessed using a multivariate logistic regression, adjusted on age, level of education, baseline CD4+ T cell count, first and current antiretroviral regimens and time on ART. RESULTS: Of 2303 patients (74.2% women; median age: 40 years; median time on ART: 34 months), 172 had virologic failure and 2131 had virologic success. Among the former, 130 (75.6%) had confirmed virologic failure, 38 (22.1%) had viro-immunologic failure, and four (2.3%) had viro-clinical failure. The proportion of men was significantly higher among the cases than among the controls (37.2% vs. 24.9%; p<0.001). Compared to controls, cases were also younger, more immunodeficient at ART initiation, less likely to receive a protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral regimen and had spent a longer period of time on ART. After adjustment, male gender remained strongly associated with virologic failure (odds ratio 2.52, 95% CI: 1.77-3.60; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Men on ART appeared more vulnerable to virologic failure than women. Additional studies are needed to confirm the poorer prognosis of men in this setting and to determine the causes for their vulnerability in order to optimize HIV care. From now on, efforts should be made to support the adherence of men to ART in the African setting.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effects of antiretroviral treatment (ART) in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have not been established. OBJECTIVE: To assess therapeutic outcomes of integrating ART with treatment for MDR-TB. DESIGN: A subgroup of MDR-TB patients from a randomised controlled trial, the SAPiT (Starting Antiretroviral Therapy at Three Points in Tuberculosis) study, conducted in an out-patient clinic in Durban, South Africa, from 2008 to 2012. METHODS: Clinical outcomes at 18 months were compared in patients randomised to receive ART within 12 weeks of initiating standard first-line anti-tuberculosis treatment with those who commenced ART after completing anti-tuberculosis treatment. RESULTS: Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug susceptibility results were available in 489 (76%) of 642 SAPiT patients: 23 had MDR-TB, 14 in the integrated treatment arm and 9 in the sequential treatment arm. At 18 months, the mortality rate was 11.9/100 person-years (py; 95%CI 1.4-42.8) in the combined integrated treatment arm and 56.0/100 py (95%CI 18.2-130.8) in the sequential treatment arm (hazard ratio adjusted for baseline CD4 count and whether MDR-TB treatment was initiated: 0.14; 95%CI 0.02-0.94, P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Despite the small sample size, the 86% reduction in mortality due to early initiation of ART in MDR-TB patients was statistically significant.</td>

      <td>Choosing profile double-sampling designs for survival estimation with application to President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief evaluation.</td>
      <td>Most studies that follow subjects over time are challenged by having some subjects who dropout. Double sampling is a design that selects and devotes resources to intensively pursue and find a subset of these dropouts, then uses data obtained from these to adjust naive estimates, which are potentially biased by the dropout. Existing methods to estimate survival from double sampling assume a random sample. In limited-resource settings, however, generating accurate estimates using a minimum of resources is important. We propose using double-sampling designs that oversample certain profiles of dropouts as more efficient alternatives to random designs. First, we develop a framework to estimate the survival function under these profile double-sampling designs. We then derive the precision of these designs as a function of the rule for selecting different profiles, in order to identify more efficient designs. We illustrate using data from the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief-funded HIV care and treatment program in western Kenya. Our results show why and how more efficient designs should oversample patients with shorter dropout times. Further, our work suggests generalizable practice for more efficient double-sampling designs, which can help maximize efficiency in resource-limited settings.</td>

      <td>Comparison of methods for correction of mortality estimates for loss to follow-up after ART initiation: a case of the Infectious Diseases Institute, Uganda.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, a large proportion of HIV positive patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are lost to follow-up, some of whom are dead. The objective of this study was to validate methods used to correct mortality estimates for loss-to-follow-up using a cohort with complete death ascertainment. METHODS: Routinely collected data from HIV patients initiating first line antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) (Routine Cohort) was used. Three methods to estimate mortality after initiation were: 1) standard Kaplan-Meier estimation (uncorrected method) that uses passively observed data; 2) double-sampling methods by Frangakis and Rubin (F&R) where deaths obtained from patient tracing studies are given a higher weight than those passively ascertained; 3) Nomogram proposed by Egger et al. Corrected mortality estimates in the Routine Cohort, were compared with the estimates from the IDI research observational cohort (Research Cohort), which was used as the "gold-standard". RESULTS: We included 5,633 patients from the Routine Cohort and 559 from the Research Cohort. Uncorrected mortality estimates (95% confidence interval [1]) in the Routine Cohort at 1, 2 and 3 years were 5.5% (4.9%-6.3%), 6.6% (5.9%-7.5%) and 7.4% (6.5%-8.5%), respectively. The F&R corrected estimates at 1, 2 and 3 years were 11.2% (5.8%-21.2%), 15.8% (9.9%-24.8%) and 18.5% (12.3% -27.2%) respectively. The estimates obtained from the Research Cohort were 15.6% (12.8%-18.9%), 17.5% (14.6%-21.0%) and 19.0% (15.3%-21.9%) at 1, 2 and 3 years respectively. Using the nomogram method in the Routine Cohort, the corrected programme-level mortality estimate in year 1 was 11.9% (8.0%-15.7%). CONCLUSION: Mortality adjustments provided by the F&R and nomogram methods are adequate and should be employed to correct mortality for loss-to-follow-up in large HIV care centres in Sub-Saharan Africa.</td>

      <td>Effectiveness of prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission programmes in Kilimanjaro region, northern Tanzania.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To monitor the effectiveness of the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) components in reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Kilimanjaro region, Tanzania. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective registry-based cohort study of HIV-exposed children aged 4 weeks to 18 months. Eligible children had a DNA polymerase chain reaction HIV antigen test between January 2009 and August 2012. We collected and analysed the data on the PMTCT components provided. We used logistic regression to explore factors associated with successful PMTCT usage and with infant infection. RESULTS: We studied 561 children; 283 (50.5%) were from rural areas. Breastfeeding was reported by 519 (92.5%) of mothers. In 469 (83.6%) mother-baby pairs, both received chemoprophylaxis, whereas in 9 (1.6%) pairs, neither mother nor baby received any chemoprophylaxis. Of the 522 (93.0%) infants with known outcomes at 6 months, 227 (43.5%) were alive, 258 (49.4%) were lost to follow-up, 34 (6.5%) had transferred and 3 (0.6%) had died. A total of 54 (9.6%) children were infected. Transmission rates of HIV when only the mother (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.49, 95% CI: 0.47-4.77) or only the baby (aOR 1.06, 95% CI: 0.23-5.01) received chemoprophylaxis were not significantly different from transmission rates when both mother and baby received antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis. Mixed feeding practices were not associated with significantly increased risk (aOR 4.09, 95% CI: 0.58-28.76) compared with exclusive breastfeeding. CONCLUSION: This study showed that rate of MTCT of HIV was 9.6% in Tanzania between 2009 and 2012. The intrapartum and child chemoprophylaxis components of the PMTCT programme were well implemented with 84% of both mothers and their babies getting full chemoprophylaxis, and effective in reducing mother-to-child transmission.</td>

      <td>Bacteremia as a cause of fever in ambulatory, HIV-infected Mozambican adults: results and policy implications from a prospective observational study.</td>
      <td>Fever is typically treated empirically in rural Mozambique. We examined the distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacterial pathogens isolated from blood-culture specimens, and clinical characteristics of ambulatory HIV-infected febrile patients with and without bacteremia. This analysis was nested within a larger prospective observational study to evaluate the performance of new Mozambican guidelines for fever and anemia in HIV-infected adults (clinical trial registration NCT01681914, www.clinicaltrials.gov); the guidelines were designed to be used by non-physician clinicians who attended ambulatory HIV-infected patients in very resource-constrained peripheral health units. In 2012 (April-September), we recruited 258 HIV-infected adults with documented fever or history of recent fever in three sites within Zambezia Province, Mozambique. Although febrile patients were routinely tested for malaria, blood culture capacity was unavailable in Zambezia prior to study initiation. We confirmed bacteremia in 39 (15.1%) of 258 patients. The predominant organisms were non-typhoid Salmonella, nearly all resistant to multiple first-line antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Features most associated with bacteremia included higher temperature, lower CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, lower hemoglobin, and headache. Introduction of blood cultures allowed us to: 1) confirm bacteremia in a substantial proportion of patients; 2) tailor specific antimicrobial therapy for confirmed bacteremia based on known susceptibilities; 3) make informed choices of presumptive antibiotics for patients with suspected bacteremia; and 4) construct a preliminary clinical profile to help clinicians determine who would most likely benefit from presumptive bacteremia treatment. Our findings demonstrate that in resource-limited settings, there is urgent need to expand local microbiologic capacity to better identify and treat cases of bacteremia in HIV-infected and other patients, and to support surveillance. Data on the prevalence and susceptibility patterns of important pathogens can guide national formulary and prescribing practices.</td>

      <td>How much demand for New HIV prevention technologies can we really expect? Results from a discrete choice experiment in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: For the first time in the history of HIV, new bio-medical interventions have been shown to be effective in preventing HIV transmission. For these new HIV prevention technologies (NPTs) to have an impact on the epidemic, they must be widely used. This study uses a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to: understand the relative strength of women's preferences for product characteristics, understand the implications for substitution away from male condoms, and inform realistic modelling of their potential impact and cost-effectiveness. METHODS: A DCE was conducted among 1017 women in urban South Africa. Women were presented with choices between potential women's NPTs (microbicides, diaphragm, female condom) and 'what I did last time' (use or not use a condom) with different HIV and pregnancy prevention effectiveness' and prices. Choice probabilities are estimated using the nested logit model and used to predict uptake. RESULTS: In this high HIV prevalence setting, HIV prevention effectiveness is the main driver of uptake followed by pregnancy prevention effectiveness. For example a microbicide with poor effectiveness would have niche appeal at just 11% predicted uptake, while a highly effective microbicide (95% effective against HIV and pregnancy) would have far wider appeal (56% predicted uptake). Though women who reported not using condoms were more likely to choose the NPTs, at current very high rates of male condom use in South Africa (60%), about half of microbicide uptake is projected to be among those currently not using condoms. CONCLUSIONS: Women are very interested in NPTs, especially if highly effective in preventing HIV and pregnancy. Women in greatest need were also most likely to switch to the new products. Where products are not yet available for distribution, proxy data, such as that generated by DCEs, can bring realism to overly optimistic uptake scenarios found in many current impact models.</td>

      <td>Prognosis of children with HIV-1 infection starting antiretroviral therapy in Southern Africa: a collaborative analysis of treatment programs.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Prognostic models for children starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Africa are lacking. We developed models to estimate the probability of death during the first year receiving ART in Southern Africa. METHODS: We analyzed data from children </=10 years of age who started ART in Malawi, South Africa, Zambia or Zimbabwe from 2004 to 2010. Children lost to follow up or transferred were excluded. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality in the first year of ART. We used Weibull survival models to construct 2 prognostic models: 1 with CD4%, age, World Health Organization clinical stage, weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) and anemia and the other without CD4%, because it is not routinely measured in many programs. We used multiple imputation to account for missing data. RESULTS: Among 12,655 children, 877 (6.9%) died in the first year of ART. We excluded 1780 children who were lost to follow up/transferred from main analyses; 10,875 children were therefore included. With the CD4% model probability of death at 1 year ranged from 1.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5-2.3] in children 5-10 years with CD4% >/=10%, World Health Organization stage I/II, WAZ >/= -2 and without severe anemia to 46.3% (95% CI: 38.2-55.2) in children <1 year with CD4% < 5%, stage III/IV, WAZ< -3 and severe anemia. The corresponding range for the model without CD4% was 2.2% (95% CI: 1.8-2.7) to 33.4% (95% CI: 28.2-39.3). Agreement between predicted and observed mortality was good (C-statistics = 0.753 and 0.745 for models with and without CD4%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These models may be useful to counsel children/caregivers, for program planning and to assess program outcomes after allowing for differences in patient disease severity characteristics.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: To delineate the association between baseline socioeconomic status (SES) indicators and mortality and lost to follow-up (LTFU) in a cohort of HIV-infected individuals enrolled in antiretroviral therapy (ART) in urban Uganda. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study nested in an antiretroviral clinic-based cohort. METHODS: SES indicators including education, employment status, and a standardized wealth index, and other demographic and clinical variables were assessed at baseline among ART-treated patients in a clinic-based cohort in Kampala, Uganda. Confirmed mortality (primary outcome) and LTFU (secondary outcome) were actively ascertained over a 4-year follow-up period from 2005 to 2009. RESULTS: Among 1763 adults [70.5% female; mean age, 36.2 years (SD = 8.4)] enrolled in ART, 14.4% (n = 253) were confirmed dead and 19.7% (n = 346) were LTFU at 4-year follow-up. No formal education [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.76; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19 to 2.59], having fewer than 6 dependents (AOR 1.39; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.86), unemployment (AOR 1.98; 95% CI: 1.48 to 2.66), and housing tenure index score (a component of the wealth index) (AOR 1.11; 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.23) were significantly associated with confirmed mortality at 4 years. SES indicators were not associated with LTFU at 4 years. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline SES indicators, including education, number of dependents, employment status, and components of a standard wealth index may indicate long-term vulnerability to mortality in patients with HIV/AIDS, despite uniform access to ART. Future studies delineating the pathways through which poverty and limited assets affect clinical outcomes may lead to more effective HIV interventions in low-resource settings.</td>

      <td>Incidence of serious morbidity in HIV-infected adults on antiretroviral therapy in a West African care centre, 2003-2008.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In resource-limited settings, scaling-up antiretroviral treatment (ART) has required the involvement of decentralized health facilities with limited equipment. We estimated the incidence of serious morbidity among HIV-infected adults receiving ART in one of these HIV routine care center in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study at the Centre Medical de Suivi des Donneurs de Sang (CMSDS), which is affiliated with the National Centre for Blood Transfusion in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. Adult patients infected with HIV-1 or HIV-1/HIV-2 who initiated ART between January 2003 and December 2008 were eligible for the study. Standardized clinical data were collected at each visit. Serious morbidity was defined as a new episode of malaria, WHO stage 3-4 event, ANRS grade 3-4 adverse event, or any event leading to death or to hospitalization. RESULTS: 1008 adults, 67% women, with a median age of 35 years, and a median pre-ART CD4 count of 186/mm3 started ART and were followed for a median of 17.3 months. The overall incidences of loss to follow-up, death, and attrition were 6.2/100 person-years (PY) [95% CI 5.1-7.2], 2.3/100 PY [95% CI 1.6-2.9], and 8.1/100 PY [95% CI 7.0-9.4], respectively. The incidence of first serious event was 11.5/100 PY overall, 15.9/100 PY within the first year and 8.3/100 PY thereafter. The most frequently documented specific diagnoses were malaria, tuberculosis, bacterial septicemia and bacterial pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Among HIV-infected adults followed in routine conditions in a West African primary care clinic, we recorded a high incidence of serious morbidity during the first year on ART. Providing care centers with diagnostic tools and standardizing data collection are necessary steps to improve the quality of care in primary care facilities in sub-Saharan Africa.</td>

      <td>A pilot cohort study to assess the feasibility of HIV prevention science research among men who have sex with men in Dakar, Senegal.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately burdened by HIV in Senegal, across sub-Saharan Africa and throughout the world. This is driven in part by stigma, and limits health achievements and social capital among these populations. To date, there is a limited understanding of the feasibility of prospective HIV prevention studies among MSM in Senegal, including HIV incidence and cohort retention rates. METHODS: One hundred and nineteen men who reported having anal sex with another man in the past 12 months were randomly selected from a sampling frame of 450 unique members of community groups serving MSM in Dakar. These men were enrolled in a 15-month pilot cohort study implemented by a community-based partner. The study included a structured survey instrument and biological testing for HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B virus at two time points. RESULTS: Baseline HIV prevalence was 36.0% (43/114), with cumulative HIV prevalence at study end being 47.2% (51/108). The annualized incidence rate was 16% (8/40 at risk for seroconversion over 15 months of follow-up, 95% confidence interval 4.6-27.4%). Thirty-seven men were lost to follow up, including at least four deaths. Men who were able to confide in someone about health, emotional distress and sex were less likely to be HIV positive (OR 0.36, p < 0.05, 95% CI 0.13, 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: High HIV prevalence and incidence, as well as mortality in this young population of Senegalese MSM indicate a public health emergency. Moreover, given the high burden of HIV and rate of incident HIV infections, this population appears to be appropriate for the evaluation of novel HIV prevention, treatment and care approaches. Using a study implemented by community-based organizations, there appears to be feasibility in implementing interventions addressing the multiple levels of HIV risk among MSM in this setting. However, low retention across arms of this pilot intervention, and in the cohort, will need to be addressed for larger-scale efficacy trials to be feasible.</td>

      <td>Temporal trends in the characteristics of children at antiretroviral therapy initiation in southern Africa: the IeDEA-SA Collaboration.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Since 2005, increasing numbers of children have started antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa and, in recent years, WHO and country treatment guidelines have recommended ART initiation for all infants and very young children, and at higher CD4 thresholds for older children. We examined temporal changes in patient and regimen characteristics at ART start using data from 12 cohorts in 4 countries participating in the IeDEA-SA collaboration. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Data from 30,300 ART-naive children aged <16 years at ART initiation who started therapy between 2005 and 2010 were analysed. We examined changes in median values for continuous variables using the Cuzick's test for trend over time. We also examined changes in the proportions of patients with particular disease severity characteristics (expressed as a binary variable e.g. WHO Stage III/IV vs I/II) using logistic regression. Between 2005 and 2010 the number of children starting ART each year increased and median age declined from 63 months (2006) to 56 months (2010). Both the proportion of children <1 year and >/=10 years of age increased from 12 to 19% and 18 to 22% respectively. Children had less severe disease at ART initiation in later years with significant declines in the percentage with severe immunosuppression (81 to 63%), WHO Stage III/IV disease (75 to 62%), severe anemia (12 to 7%) and weight-for-age z-score<-3 (31 to 28%). Similar results were seen when restricting to infants with significant declines in the proportion with severe immunodeficiency (98 to 82%) and Stage III/IV disease (81 to 63%). First-line regimen use followed country guidelines. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Between 2005 and 2010 increasing numbers of children have initiated ART with a decline in disease severity at start of therapy. However, even in 2010, a substantial number of infants and children started ART with advanced disease. These results highlight the importance of efforts to improve access to HIV diagnostic testing and ART in children.</td>

      <td>Treatment outcomes of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients in Gauteng, South Africa.</td>
      <td>PURPOSE: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is associated with lengthy treatment, expensive and potentially toxic regimens, and high rates of treatment failure and death. This study describes the outcomes of 351 MDR-TB patients who started treatment between 2004 and 2007 at the provincial MDR-TB referral hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa, and investigates risk factors associated with death. METHODS: The study involved the assessment of factors associated with treatment outcomes using a retrospective review of patient records, drug-susceptibility data and spoligotyping of isolates. RESULTS: Treatment success (completion/cure) was recorded in 158 (48.8 %) patients, while 65 (20 %) died, 93 (28.7 %) defaulted, 8 (2.5 %) failed treatment, 11(3.1 %) were transferred out to other health facilities and 16 (4.6 %) had no recorded final outcome. The proportion of successful treatment increased significantly over time. Univariable and multivariable analysis (P = 0.05) identified the year of MDR-TB diagnosis and spoligotype-defined families as factors associated with treatment outcome. No associations were found between treatment outcome and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, previous TB and additional MDR resistance to streptomycin or ethambutol. Molecular typing of the strains revealed a diverse group of spoligotypes, with Beijing, LAM4 and H3 making up the largest groups. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first published study to investigate treatment outcomes at this facility and to find a link between genotype and treatment outcome, suggesting that genotype determination could potentially serve as a prognostic factor.</td>

      <td>The use of pill counts as a facilitator of adherence with antiretroviral therapy in resource limited settings.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Pill counts are often used to measure adherence to ART, but there is little data on how they affect adherence. We previously showed a bivariate relationship between clinicians counting pills and adherence in patients receiving HIV care in Kenya. We present a secondary analysis of the relationship between numbers of pill counts and clinical outcomes in resource limited settings. METHODS: Patients initiating ART at Kijabe Hospital were monitored for the number of discretionary pill counts performed by their clinician in the first 6 months of ART. Subjects were followed for at least 1 year after enrollment. The number of clinician pill counts was correlated to ART adherence. The primary endpoints were time to treatment failure, defined as a detectable HIV-1 viral load, death; or loss to follow-up. RESULTS: Clinician pill counts were done at 68% of clinic visits for 304 subjects. There was a positive correlation between the number of clinician pill counts and ART adherence (r = 0.21, p <0.001). Patients were divided into 3 groups (0 counts, 1 to 3 counts, 4 to 7 counts) and exhibited adherence of 76%, 84%, and 92%, respectively (p = 0.004). Time to treatment failure for these groups was 220 days, 438 days, and 497 days (P<0.01), respectively. Time to virologic failure in living patients remaining in the cohort was longer in those with more pill count (P =0.02). Multi-variate analysis adjusting for co-variates affecting time to treatment failure found that that clinician pill counts were associated with a decreased risk of treatment failure (HR = 0.69, p =0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The number of clinician pill count performed was independently associated with better adherence and a decreased risk of treatment failure. The use of clinician pill counts should be further studied as an adherence promoter through a randomized clinical trial.</td>

      <td>Linkage to HIV care and antiretroviral therapy by HIV testing service type in Central Mozambique: a retrospective cohort study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased dramatically in resource-limited settings since its introduction a decade ago. However, ART coverage remains low in countries with the highest disease burden, which may be partially explained by poor testing to care linkages. HIV testing service may impact early attrition in the HIV treatment cascade. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 18 clinics in central Mozambique using routine patient data and monthly reports. Patients referred from voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) were compared with those referred from prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) for 3 outcomes: (1) enrollment at an HIV clinic </=30 days after testing HIV positive, (2) CD4 test </=30 days after enrollment, and (3) ART initiation </=90 days after first CD4 test. RESULTS: Patient retention in the HIV care system dropped at each step from HIV testing to ART initiation. Enrollment in HIV care was not significantly different between PMTCT and VCT [risk ratio (RR) = 0.84, 0.72 < RR < 1.02]. Women tested in PMTCT were less likely to have a CD4 test </=30 days after enrollment when adjusting for age, education level, and marital status (adjusted RR = 0.84, 0.70 < RR < 1.00), and were less likely to initiate ART </=90 days after their first CD4 test when adjusting for age, education, and marital status (adjusted RR = 0.56, 0.44 < RR < 0.71). CONCLUSIONS: Poor linkages between HIV testing and care hamper efforts to improve coverage for HIV care and treatment services. Increased loss to follow-up among women diagnosed in PMTCT relative to VCT is worrisome and merits further qualitative research and programmatic attention.</td>

      <td>Tracing of patients lost to follow-up and HIV transmission: mathematical modeling study based on 2 large ART programs in Malawi.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: Treatment as prevention depends on retaining HIV-infected patients in care. We investigated the effect on HIV transmission of bringing patients lost to follow-up (LTFU) back into care. DESIGN: Mathematical model. METHODS: Stochastic mathematical model of cohorts of 1000 HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy, based on the data from 2 clinics in Lilongwe, Malawi. We calculated cohort viral load (sum of individual mean viral loads each year) and used a mathematical relationship between viral load and transmission probability to estimate the number of new HIV infections. We simulated 4 scenarios: "no LTFU" (all patients stay in care), "no tracing" (patients LTFU are not traced), "immediate tracing" (after missed clinic appointment), and "delayed tracing" (after 6 months). RESULTS: About 440 of 1000 patients were LTFU over 5 years. Cohort viral loads (million copies/mL per 1000 patients) were 3.7 [95% prediction interval (PrI), 2.9-4.9] for no LTFU, 8.6 (95% PrI, 7.3-10.0) for no tracing, 7.7 (95% PrI, 6.2-9.1) for immediate, and 8.0 (95% PrI, 6.7-9.5) for delayed tracing. Comparing no LTFU with no tracing, the number of new infections increased from 33 (95% PrI, 29-38) to 54 (95% PrI, 47-60) per 1000 patients. Immediate tracing prevented 3.6 (95% PrI, -3.3 to 12.8) and delayed tracing 2.5 (95% PrI, -5.8 to 11.1) new infections per 1000. Immediate tracing was more efficient than delayed tracing: to 116 and 142 tracing efforts, respectively, were needed prevent 1 new infection. CONCLUSIONS: Tracing of patients LTFU enhances the preventive effect of antiretroviral therapy, but the number of transmissions prevented is small.</td>

      <td>Experiences on recruitment and retention of volunteers in the first HIV vaccine trial in Dar es Salam, Tanzania - the phase I/II HIVIS 03 trial.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Eventual control of HIV/AIDS is believed to be ultimately dependent on a safe, effective and affordable vaccine. Participation of sub-Saharan Africa in the conduct of HIV trials is crucial as this region still experiences high HIV incidences. We describe the experience of recruiting and retaining volunteers in the first HIV vaccine trial (HIVIS03) in Tanzania. METHODS: In this trial enrolled volunteers from amongst Police Officers (POs) in Dar es Salaam were primed with HIV-1 DNA vaccine at months 0, 1 and 3; and boosted with HIV-1 MVA vaccine at months 9 and 21. A stepwise education provision/sensitization approach was employed to eventual recruitment. Having identified a "core" group of POs keen on HIV prevention activities, those interested to participate in the vaccine trial were invited for a first screening session that comprised of provision of detailed study information and medical evaluation. In the second screening session results of the initial assessment were provided and those eligible were assessed for willingness to participate (WTP). Those willing were consented and eventually randomized into the trial having met the eligibility criteria. Voluntary participation was emphasized throughout. RESULTS: Out of 408 POs who formed the core group, 364 (89.0%) attended the educational sessions. 263 out of 364 (72.2%) indicated willingness to participate in the HIV vaccine trial. 98% of those indicating WTP attended the pre-screening workshops. 220 (85.0%) indicated willingness to undergo first screening and 177 POs attended for initial screenings, of whom 162 (91.5%) underwent both clinical and laboratory screenings. 119 volunteers (73.5%) were eligible for the study. 79 were randomized into the trial, while 19 did not turn up, the major reason being partner/family advice. 60 volunteers including 15 females were recruited during a one-year period. All participated in the planned progress updates workshops. Retention into the schedule was: 98% for the 3 DNA/placebo vaccinations, while it was 83% and 73% for the first and second MVA/placebo vaccinations respectively. CONCLUSION: In this first HIV vaccine trial in Tanzania, we successfully recruited the volunteers and there was no significant loss to follow up. Close contact and updates on study progress facilitated the observed retention rates. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS: ISRCTN90053831 ISRNCT01132976 and ATMR2009040001075080.</td>

      <td>The role of polymerase chain reaction in early diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus infection in infants.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is rising in Sub- Saharan Africa. The various indirect tests readily available have not been helpful in neonatal and early infant diagnosis of the disease. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a direct test that can be used in these groups of children. Early infant diagnosis is important in achieving good outcome in the management of HIV infection. The aim of this article was to examine the role of PCR in the evaluation HIV-infected infants, with a view to achieve early diagnosis, early treatment, and good outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective review of 174 infants delivered by HIV-infected mothers in a rural hospital from January 2007 to September 2008. The blood samples of the patients were collected and subjected to PCR analysis for detection of viral antigen. Two samples were collected, the first at 6 weeks and the second 6 weeks after that. The results were recorded, collated, and analyzed using SPSS version 17. RESULTS: There were 174 infants, 100 boys, and 74 girls. The age range was 6-8 weeks (median 6 weeks). PCR was positive for both the samples in 12 (6.9%) infants. PCR was negative in both samples in 162 (93.1%) infants. All infants who were negative in the first sampling were found to be negative in the second sampling as well. None of the infant was positive for only one sample. Analysis of 12 positive infants revealed that 5 (2.9%) infants were placed on anti-retroviral drugs, 3 (1.7%) infants were not placed on anti-retroviral drugs because of low CD+ count, and 1 (1.0%) infant was lost to follow-up, while 3 (1.7%) infants died from sepsis. CONCLUSION: PCR has a role as a direct test in early diagnosis of HIV infection in infancy, particularly where the other direct test are not readily available.</td>

      <td>The survival benefits of antiretroviral therapy in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: We sought to quantify the survival benefits attributable to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa since 2004. METHODS: We used the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications-International model (CEPAC) to simulate 8 cohorts of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients initiating ART each year during 2004-2011. Model inputs included cohort-specific mean CD4(+) T-cell count at ART initiation (112-178 cells/microL), 24-week ART suppressive efficacy (78%), second-line ART availability (2.4% of ART recipients), and cohort-specific 36-month retention rate (55%-71%). CEPAC simulated survival twice for each cohort, once with and once without ART. The sum of the products of per capita survival differences and the total numbers of persons initiating ART for each cohort yielded the total survival benefits. RESULTS: Lifetime per capita survival benefits ranged from 9.3 to 10.2 life-years across the 8 cohorts. Total estimated population lifetime survival benefit for all persons starting ART during 2004-2011 was 21.7 million life-years, of which 2.8 million life-years (12.7%) had been realized by December 2012. By 2030, benefits reached 17.9 million life-years under current policies, 21.7 million life-years with universal second-line ART, 23.3 million life-years with increased linkage to care of eligible untreated patients, and 28.0 million life-years with both linkage to care and universal second-line ART. CONCLUSIONS: We found dramatic past and potential future survival benefits attributable to ART, justifying international support of ART rollout in South Africa.</td>

Studies investigating interventions to improve linkage to, and retention in, pre-ART care in sub-Saharan Africa were reviewed. Certain interventions used to overcome economic barriers for ART-patients (i.e. integration of services, medical and food incentives, intensified counselling and peer support) have also shown favourable results in the pre-ART period. A combined package of interventions found to be effective in the pre-ART and ART period might be effective for reducing attrition in both periods.

      <td>Evaluation of differences between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men and women in antiretroviral therapy (ART) enrollment characteristics and outcomes might identify opportunities to improve ART program patient outcomes and prevention impact. During September 2008-February 2012, retrospective cohort studies to estimate attrition of enrollees (i.e., from death, stopping ART, or loss to follow-up) at 6-month intervals after ART initiation were completed among samples of adult men and women (defined as aged >/=15 years or aged >/=18 years) who initiated ART during 2004-2010 in six African countries: Cote d'Ivoire in western Africa; Swaziland, Mozambique, and Zambia in southern Africa; and Uganda and Tanzania in eastern Africa. Records for 13,175 ART enrollees were analyzed; sample sizes among the six countries ranged from 1,457 to 3,682. In each country, women comprised 61%-67% of ART enrollees. Median CD4 count range was 119-141 cells/microL for men and 137-161 cells/microL for women. Compared with women, a greater percentage of men initiated ART who had World Health Organization (WHO) HIV stage IV disease. In cohorts from western Africa and southern Africa, the risk for attrition was 15%-26% lower among women compared with men in multivariable analysis. However, in eastern Africa, differences between men and women in risk for attrition were not statistically significant. Research to identify country-specific causes for increased attrition and delayed initiation of care among men could identify strategies to improve ART program outcomes among men, which might contribute to prevention of new HIV infections in female partners.</td>

      <td>Outcomes of antiretroviral treatment programmes in rural Lesotho: health centres and hospitals compared.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Lesotho was among the first countries to adopt decentralization of care from hospitals to nurse-led health centres (HCs) to scale up the provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We compared outcomes between patients who started ART at HCs and hospitals in two rural catchment areas in Lesotho. METHODS: The two catchment areas comprise two hospitals and 12 HCs. Patients >/=16 years starting ART at a hospital or HC between 2008 and 2011 were included. Loss to follow-up (LTFU) was defined as not returning to the facility for >/=180 days after the last visit, no follow-up (no FUP) as not returning after starting ART, and retention in care as alive and on ART at the facility. The data were analysed using logistic regression, competing risk regression and Kaplan-Meier methods. Multivariable analyses were adjusted for sex, age, CD4 cell count, World Health Organization stage, catchment area and type of ART. All analyses were stratified by gender. RESULTS: Of 3747 patients, 2042 (54.5%) started ART at HCs. Both women and men at hospitals had more advanced clinical and immunological stages of disease than those at HCs. Over 5445 patient-years, 420 died and 475 were LTFU. Kaplan-Meier estimates for three-year retention were 68.7 and 69.7% at HCs and hospitals, respectively, among women (p=0.81) and 68.8% at HCs versus 54.7% at hospitals among men (p<0.001). These findings persisted in adjusted analyses, with similar retention at HCs and hospitals among women (odds ratio (OR): 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73-1.09) and higher retention at HCs among men (OR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.20-1.96). The latter result was mainly driven by a lower proportion of patients LTFU at HCs (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.51-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: In rural Lesotho, overall retention in care did not differ significantly between nurse-led HCs and hospitals. However, men seemed to benefit most from starting ART at HCs, as they were more likely to remain in care in these facilities compared to hospitals.</td>

      <td>Personal barriers to antiretroviral therapy adherence: case studies from a rural Uganda prospective clinical cohort.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Although good adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is essential for successful treatment outcomes, some patients may have specific personal barriers to ART adherence. OBJECTIVES: To study specific personal barriers to ART adherence. METHODS: Quantitative data on patients' health status, ART adherence, CD4 cell counts and viral loads were collected, and qualitative data on life experiences of five patients with poor ART outcomes and adherence were also collected. RESULTS: Out of 35 patients with poor immunological and virological ART outcomes, 17 (49%) also had poor ART adherence. Patient 1 had no living child and did not disclose her HIV serostatus to her spouse because she wanted to have a child. Patient 2 was an orphan with neither social nor family support. Patient 3 stopped ART when she conceived, returned to the study clinic when pregnant again and was sickly. She was switched to second-line ART with satisfactory outcomes. Patient 4, a 14 year old orphan had missed ART for 2 months when his treatment supporter was away. Patient 5 aged 66 years stopped ART which he blamed for his erectile dysfunction. CONCLUSION: ART adherence counselling should target specific personal barriers to ART adherence like: lack of family support, health and sexual life concerns, desire to have children and family instability.</td>

      <td>We modeled nevirapine (NVP) pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected Malawian patients to assess the relationship between drug exposure and patient characteristics, genetic polymorphisms, and development of hypersensitivity reaction (HSR). One thousand one hundred seventeen patients were prospectively recruited and followed for 26 weeks with multiple or single serum samples obtained in a subset of patients for NVP quantification. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 genes were typed. Nonlinear mixed effects modeling was utilized to assess the influence of patient characteristics and host genetics on NVP apparent oral clearance (CL/F) and to explore the relationship between NVP CL/F and HSR. Published haplotype distributions were used to simulate NVP concentrations in Caucasians versus Africans. One hundred eighty patients (101 female) were included in the model; 25 experienced HSR. No associations between patient demographics or HSR and NVP CL/F were evident. A significant relationship between CYP2B6 c.983T>C and CYP2B6 c.516G>T and NVP CL/F was observed (P < 0.01). NVP CL/F was reduced by 23% and 36% in patients with CYP2B6 983TT/516TT and 983TC/516GG or GT, respectively, compared to the reference genotype. Simulated exposures suggested similar proportions (13 to 17%) of patients with subtherapeutic NVP among Caucasians and an African population. Influence of CYP2B6 polymorphisms on NVP CL/F in this population is in agreement with other reports. Our data indicate a lack of association between NVP exposure and HSR. Based on these data, dose optimization based solely on ethnicity (without individual gene testing) is unlikely to impact on risk of treatment failure or toxicity even in an African population with high carriage of poor metabolizer mutations.</td>

      <td>Genetic analysis and natural polymorphisms in HIV-1 gp41 isolates from Maputo City, Mozambique.</td>
      <td>Enfuvirtide was the first fusion inhibitor approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2003 for HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced patient. It is the first approved antiviral agent to attack the HIV life cycle in its early stages. For HIV fusion to occur, the HR1 and HR2 domains in the gp41 region need to interact. Enfuvirtide is a synthetic peptide that corresponds to 36 amino acids of the HR2, which competitively binds to HR1 inhibiting the interaction with the HR2 domain thus preventing fusogenic conformation and inhibiting viral entry into host cells. Resistance to enfuvirtide is conferred by mutations occurring in the HR1 region involving residues 36-45. Mozambique, a sub-Saharan country, with an HIV prevalence of 11.5%, provides first line and second line antiretroviral therapy (ART)-based treatment. In poor resource settings such as Mozambique the lack of adequate infrastructures, the high costs of viral load tests, and the availability of salvage treatment have hindered the intended objective of monitoring HIV treatment, suggesting an important concern regarding the development of drug resistance. The general aim of this study was to evaluate naturally occurring polymorphisms and resistance-associated mutations in the gp41 region of HIV-1 isolates from Mozambique. The study included 78 patients naive to ARV treatment and 28 patients failing first line regimen recruited from Centro de Saude Alto-Mae situated in Maputo. The gp41 gene from 103 patients was sequenced and resistance-associated mutations for enfuvirtide were screened. Subtype analysis revealed that 96% of the sequences were classified as subtype C, 2% as subtype G, 1% as subtype A1, and the other 1% as a mosaic form composed of A1/C. No enfuvirtide resistance-associated mutations in HR1 of gp41 were detected. The major polymorphisms in the HR1 were N42S, L54M, A67T, and V72I. This study suggests that this new class of antiviral drug may be effective as a salvage therapy in patients failing first line regimens in Mozambique. However, further phenotypic studies are required to determine the clinical relevance of the polymorphisms detected in this study.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: To describe predictors of contraceptive method discontinuation and switching behaviours among HIV-positive couples receiving couples' voluntary HIV counselling and testing services in Lusaka, Zambia. DESIGN: Couples were randomized in a factorial design to two-family planning educational intervention videos, received comprehensive family planning services and were assessed every 3 months for contraceptive initiation, discontinuation and switching. METHODS: We modelled factors associated with contraceptive method upgrading and downgrading via multivariate Andersen-Gill models. RESULTS: Most women continued the initial method selected after randomization. The highest rates of discontinuation/switching were observed for injectable contraceptive and intrauterine device users. Time to discontinuing the more effective contraceptive methods or downgrading to oral contraceptives or condoms was associated with the women's younger age, desire for more children within the next year, heavy menstrual bleeding, bleeding between periods and cystitis/dysuria. Health concerns among women about contraceptive implants and male partners not wanting more children were associated with upgrading from oral contraceptives or condoms. HIV status of the woman or the couple was not predictive of switching or stopping. CONCLUSION: We found complicated patterns of contraceptive use. The predictors of contraception switching indicate that interventions targeted to younger couples that address common contraception-related misconceptions could improve effective family planning utilization. We recommend these findings be used to increase the uptake and continuation of contraception, especially long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods, and that fertility goal based, LARC-focused family planning be offered as an integral part of HIV prevention services.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of pregnancy on mortality among HIV-infected Ugandan women initiating ART. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: HIV-infected women initiating ART in the Uganda AIDS Rural Treatment Outcomes study were assessed quarterly for self-reported pregnancy. The association between pregnancy and postpartum ('pregnancy-related') follow-up periods and mortality was assessed with Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, CD4 cell count, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, and ART duration. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-four women with median age 33 years (IQR: 27-37) and CD4 142 cells/mul (IQR: 82-213) were followed for a median of 4.0 years (IQR: 2.5-4.8) after ART initiation, with 3 and 7% loss-to-follow-up at years 1 and 5. One hundred and nine women experienced pregnancy. Five deaths occurred during pregnancy-related follow-up and 16 during nonpregnancy-related follow-up, for crude mortality rates during the first year after ART initiation of 12.57/100 PYs and 3.53/100 PYs (rate ratio 3.56, 95% CI: 0.97-11.07). In adjusted models, the impact of pregnancy-related follow-up on mortality was highest at ART initiation (aHR: 21.48, 95% CI: 3.73-123.51), decreasing to 13.44 (95% CI 3.28-55.11) after 4 months, 8.28 (95% CI 2.38-28.88) after 8 months, 5.18 (95% CI: 1.36-19.71) after 1 year, and 1.25 (95% CI: 0.10-15.58) after 2 years on ART. Four of five maternal deaths occurred postpartum. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy and the postpartum period were associated with increased mortality in HIV-infected women initiating ART, particularly during early ART. Contraception proximate to ART initiation, earlier ART initiation, and careful monitoring during the postpartum period may reduce maternal mortality in this setting.</td>

      <td>Successes and challenges of establishing a cervical cancer screening and treatment program in western Kenya.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To describe the challenges and successes of integrating a public-sector cervical screening program into a large HIV care system in western Kenya. METHODS: The present study was a programmatic description and a retrospective chart review of data collected from a cervical screening program based on visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) between June 2009 and October 2011. RESULTS: In total, 6787 women were screened: 1331 (19.6%) were VIA-positive, of whom 949 (71.3%) had HIV. Overall, 206 women underwent cryotherapy, 754 colposcopy, 143 loop electrical excision procedure (LEEP), and 27 hysterectomy. Among the colposcopy-guided biopsies, 27.9% had severe dysplasia and 10.9% had invasive cancer. There were 68 cases of cancer, equating to approximately 414 per 100000 women per year. Despite aggressive strategies, the overall loss to follow-up was 31.5%: 27.9% were lost after a positive VIA screen, 49.3% between biopsy and LEEP, and 59.6% between biopsy and hysterectomy/chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: The established infrastructure of an HIV treatment program was successfully used to build capacity for cervical screening in a low-resource setting. By using task-shifting and evidence-based, low-cost approaches, population-based cervical screening in a rural African clinical network was found to feasible; however, loss to follow-up and poor pathology infrastructure remain important obstacles.</td>

      <td>The HVTN503/Phambili HIV vaccine trial: a comparison of younger and older participants.</td>
      <td>By comparing younger to older participants enrolled in a HIV vaccine efficacy trial, we aimed to gain insights into the inclusion of adolescents in future trials. This was a sub-analysis of a multisite HIV vaccine randomized clinical trial in South Africa, conducted January-September 2007. Motivations for trial enrolment, social harms, adverse events and loss to follow-up were compared between younger (18-20 years old) and older participants (21-35 years old). Both younger (n = 238) and older participants (n = 563) were equally likely to report enrolling for altruistic reasons. Younger females were less likely than older participants to join for trial reimbursement (p = 0.005), while younger males were more likely to enrol because the vaccine may provide protection from HIV-acquisition (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the number of social harms reported. Compared to males over 20 years old, 18-20-year-old females were less likely to experience adverse events (OR = 0.1, CI 0.01-0.80) and no more likely to be lost to follow-up (OR = 0.7, CI 0.39-1.25), while 18-20-year-old males were no more likely to experience adverse events (OR = 1.3, CI 0.58-2.83) or loss to follow-up (OR = 0.8, CI 0.51-1.41). Our data support the inclusion of younger participants who are at risk for HIV in future HIV vaccine efficacy trials.</td>

      <td>The importance of caregivers in the outcome of pediatric HIV management, Mombasa, Kenya.</td>
      <td>We assessed programmatic gaps that prevent the optimal treatment of pediatric HIV infection despite free antiretroviral care in Kenya. Of 626 HIV-infected Kenyan children, the median age was five years, 54% were male and the mortality rate was 3.2 per 100 person-years. A total of 380 (61%) children initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) during the study period. Among the 246 children who never started ART, 129 (52%) met the criteria for ART initiation. Immunologic failure occurred in 20% of children who received ART for >24 weeks. In multivariate analysis, immunological failure was associated with having nonimmediate relative or unrelated caregivers accompanying the child to clinic (AOR = 69.16, p = 0.008). Having >/= 3 types of accompanying caregivers was also associated with virologic failure in multivariate analysis (AOR = 3.84, p = 0.03). The lost to follow-up rate was 8.7/100 persons-years for the entire cohort, and significantly higher (17.7/100 persons-years) among children not on ART (p < 0.001). Among children who do initiate ART, those with the best treatment outcomes were those who had a limited number of close relatives as caregivers and good adherence to ART. Focus on early ART initiation and education of the right caregiver will likely improve retention and quality of pediatric HIV care in Kenya.</td>

      <td>Early infant diagnosis of HIV in three regions in Tanzania; successes and challenges.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: By the end of 2009 an estimated 2.5 million children worldwide were living with HIV-1, mostly as a consequence of vertical transmission, and more than 90% of these children live in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2008 the World Health Organization (WHO), recommended early initiation of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) to all HIV infected infants diagnosed within the first year of life, and since 2010, within the first two years of life, irrespective of CD4 count or WHO clinical stage. The study aims were to describe implementation of EID programs in three Tanzanian regions with differences in HIV prevalences and logistical set-up with regard to HIV DNA testing. METHODS: Data were obtained by review of the prevention from mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) registers from 2009-2011 at the Reproductive and Child Health Clinics (RCH) and from the databases from the Care and Treatment Clinics (CTC) in all the three regions; Kilimanjaro, Mbeya and Tanga. Statistical tests used were Poisson regression model and rank sum test. RESULTS: During the period of 2009 - 2011 a total of 4,860 exposed infants were registered from the reviewed sites, of whom 4,292 (88.3%) were screened for HIV infection. Overall proportion of tested infants in the three regions increased from 77.2% in 2009 to 97.8% in 2011. A total of 452 (10.5%) were found to be HIV infected (judged by the result of the first test). The prevalence of HIV infection among infants was higher in Mbeya when compared to Kilimanjaro region RR = 1.872 (95%CI = 1.408 - 2.543) p < 0.001. However sample turnaround time was significantly shorter in both Mbeya (2.7 weeks) and Tanga (5.0 weeks) as compared to Kilimanjaro (7.0 weeks), p=<0.001. A substantial of loss to follow-up (LTFU) was evident at all stages of EID services in the period of 2009 to 2011. Among the infants who were receiving treatment, 61% were found to be LFTU during the review period. CONCLUSION: The study showed an increase in testing of HIV exposed infants within the three years, there is large variations of HIV prevalence among the regions. Challenges like; sample turnaround time and LTFU must be overcome before this can translate into the intended goal of early initiation of lifelong lifesaving antiretroviral therapy for the infants.</td>

      <td>Are they really lost? "true" status and reasons for treatment discontinuation among HIV infected patients on antiretroviral therapy considered lost to follow up in Urban Malawi.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Patients who are lost to follow-up (LTFU) while on antiretroviral therapy (ART) pose challenges to the long-term success of ART programs. We describe the extent to which patients considered LTFU are misclassified as true disengagement from care when they are still alive on ART and explain reasons for ART discontinuation using our active tracing program to further improve ART retention programs and policies. METHODS: We identified adult ART patients who missed clinic appointment by more than 3 weeks between January 2006 and December 2010, assuming that such patients would miss their doses of antiretroviral drugs. Patients considered LTFU who consented during ART registration were traced by phone or home visits; true ART status after tracing was documented. Reasons for ART discontinuation were also recorded for those who stopped ART. RESULTS: Of the 4,560 suspected LTFU cases, 1,384 (30%) could not be traced. Of the 3,176 successfully traced patients, 952 (30%) were dead and 2,224 (70%) were alive, of which 2,183 (99.5%) started ART according to phone-based self-reports or physical verification during in-person interviews. Of those who started ART, 957 (44%) stopped ART and 1,226 (56%) reported still taking ART at the time of interview by sourcing drugs from another clinic, using alternative ART sources or making brief ART interruptions. Among 940 cases with reasons for ART discontinuations, failure to remember (17%), too weak/sick (12%), travel (46%), and lack of transport to the clinic (16%) were frequently cited; reasons differed by gender. CONCLUSION: The LTFU category comprises sizeable proportions of patients still taking ART that may potentially bias retention estimates and misdirect resources at the clinic and national levels if not properly accounted for. Clinics should consider further decentralization efforts, increasing drug allocations for frequent travels, and improving communication on patient transfers between clinics to increase retention and adherence.</td>

      <td>Pharmacogenetic associations with plasma efavirenz concentrations and clinical correlates in a retrospective cohort of Ghanaian HIV-infected patients.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: Efavirenz is widely used in first-line antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa. However, exposure to efavirenz shows marked interindividual variability that is genetically mediated with potential for important pharmacodynamic consequences. The aims of this study were to assess the frequencies of CYP2B6, CYP2A6, UGT2B7 and CAR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their impact on plasma efavirenz concentration and clinical/immunological responses in Ghanaian patients. METHODS: Genomic DNA from 800 HIV-infected patients was genotyped for selected SNPs by real-time PCR-based allelic discrimination. Mid-dose plasma efavirenz concentrations were measured for 521 patients using HPLC with UV detection. Clinical outcomes in 299 patients on efavirenz were retrospectively assessed. Univariate and multivariate linear regression were performed using best subset selection. Time-to-event outcomes were analysed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS: The variant allele frequencies for CYP2B6 516G>T (rs3745274), CYP2B6 983T>C (rs28399499), CYP2A6 -48T>G (CYP2B6*9B; rs28399433), UGT2B7 802C>T (UGT2B7*2; rs7439366), UGT2B7 735A>G (UGT2B7*1c; rs28365062) and CAR 540C>T (rs2307424) were 48%, 4%, 3%, 23%, 15% and 7%, respectively. CYP2B6 516G>T, CYP2B6 983T>C and CYP2A6 -48T>G were associated with significantly elevated efavirenz concentrations. A trend towards association between plasma efavirenz concentration and CAR 540C>T was observed. CYP2B6 516G homozygosity was associated with immunological failure [adjusted hazards ratio compared with T homozygosity, 1.70 (1.04-2.76); P = 0.03]. CONCLUSIONS: CYP2B6 and CYP2A6 SNPs were associated with higher plasma efavirenz concentrations due to reduction in major and minor phase I routes of elimination, respectively. Further prospective studies are needed to validate the pharmacodynamic correlates of these polymorphisms in this population.</td>

      <td>Inadequate monitoring in advanced stages of disease with lack of supportive counseling increases attrition among patients on antiretroviral treatment at a large urban clinic in Uganda.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this case-control study was to identify risk factors for loss to follow-up (LTFU). METHODS: Cases and controls were selected from HIV-positive patients, aged 18 years and older, on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the Infectious Diseases Clinic (IDC) in January 2008. As cases, we selected 209 patients who in 2008 did not return to the clinic within 90 days of their scheduled appointment date. As controls, we randomly selected 626 patients from the 5872 patients who were following up at the end of December 2008. RESULTS: In multivariable logistic regression analysis, urban or semiurban residence, World Health Organization disease stage III or IV at ART initiation, a median CD4 count at last visit <200 cells/mm(3), tuberculosis (TB) in the 6 months before the last visit, absence of counseling before ART initiation, and no disclosure of HIV status were associated with LTFU. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the importance of close patient monitoring in advanced stages of disease, supportive counseling for patients initiating ART, extra psychosocial support for patients with TB and HIV coinfection, assisting patients with disclosure, and setting up a good referral system to retain patients on ART.</td>

      <td>HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders: antiretroviral regimen, central nervous system penetration effectiveness, and cognitive outcomes.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can give rise to a spectrum of neuropsychological impairments known collectively as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) has reduced the incidence of HIV dementia, the prevalence of milder forms of HAND has increased. It has been postulated that incomplete central nervous system (CNS) viral suppression or potential drug toxicity, both of which could be related to the CNS penetration effectiveness (CPE) of ART regimens, may contribute to this phenomenon. OBJECTIVE: This study compared cognitive outcomes in clade C-infected HIV patients in South Africa treated for 1 year with ART regimens with differing CPE scores. METHODS: We assessed 111 HIV-positive patients with varying levels of cognitive function at baseline (pre-ART) and then a year later. A neuropsychological battery was administered at both visits to derive global deficit scores. ART regimen data were collected at the follow-up visit. Some participants remained ART-naive during this period, thus providing a non-treatment control group. RESULTS: Significantly more ART recipients maintained or improved cognitive function compared with patients not on ART (p=0.017). There was no significant difference in cognitive outcomes between higher and lower CPE regimen groups (p=0.473). CONCLUSIONS: ART preserves or improves cognition in HIV-infected patients after 1 year, irrespective of the regimen's CPE. South Africa's current low CPE-scored first-line regimen performed as well as higher CPE-scored regimens. These findings are reassuring for South Africa, but larger, longer-term studies would be more definitive.</td>

      <td>High attrition before and after ART initiation among youth (15-24 years of age) enrolled in HIV care.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: To compare pre and post-ART attrition between youth (15-24 years) and other patients in HIV care, and to investigate factors associated with attrition among youth. DESIGN: Cohort study utilizing routinely collected patient-level data from 160 HIV clinics in Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Rwanda. METHODS: Patients at least 10 years of age enrolling in HIV care between 01/05 and 09/10 were included. Attrition (loss to follow-up or death 1 year after enrollment or ART initiation) was compared between youth and other patients using multivariate competing risk (pre-ART) and traditional (post-ART) Cox proportional hazards methods accounting for within-clinic correlation. Among youth, patient-level and clinic-level factors associated with attrition were similarly assessed. RESULTS: A total of 312,335 patients at least 10 years of age enrolled in HIV care; 147,936 (47%) initiated ART, 17% enrolling in care and 10% initiating ART were youth. Attrition before and after ART initiation was substantially higher among youth compared with other age groups. Among youth, nonpregnant women experienced lower pre-ART attrition than men [sub-division hazard ratio = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86-0.94], while both pregnant [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74-0.97] and nonpregnant (AHR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.73-0.86) female youth experienced lower post-ART attrition than men. Youth attending clinics providing sexual and reproductive health services including condoms (AHR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.32-0.70) and clinics offering adolescent support groups (AHR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.52-1.0) experienced significantly lower attrition after ART initiation. CONCLUSION: Youth experienced substantially higher attrition before and after ART initiation compared with younger adolescents and older adults. Adolescent-friendly services were associated with reduced attrition among youth, particularly after ART initiation.</td>

      <td>Predictors of attrition in patients ineligible for antiretroviral therapy after being diagnosed with HIV: data from an HIV cohort study in India.</td>
      <td>In newly HIV-diagnosed patients, the CD4+ lymphocyte count is measured to determine the need for antiretroviral therapy (ART). Studies from Sub-Saharan Africa have shown that patients who are ART ineligible at the first assessment have poor retention in care, but data from other low- or middle-income countries are scarce. In this study we describe the retention in pre-ART care of 1696 patients who were ineligible for ART after being diagnosed with HIV in a cohort study in India. More than one-third of ART ineligible patients had poor retention in care, and the attrition was higher in those with longer follow-up periods. Of those patients with poor retention, only 10% came back to the clinics, and their CD4 cell counts were lower than the ones of patients retained in care. After 4.5 years of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of loss to follow-up was 50%. Factors associated with attrition were being homeless, being illiterate, belonging to a disadvantaged community, being symptomatic at the time of the HIV diagnosis, male gender, and not living near a town. Widows were given nutritional support and, therefore, had better retention in care. The results of this study highlight the need to improve the retention in care of ART ineligible patients in India.</td>

      <td>Gastric outlet obstruction at Bugando Medical Centre in Northwestern Tanzania: a prospective review of 184 cases.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Gastric outlet obstruction poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to general surgeons practicing in resource-limited countries. There is a paucity of published data on this subject in our setting. This study was undertaken to highlight the etiological spectrum and treatment outcome of gastric outlet obstruction in our setting and to identify prognostic factors for morbidity and mortality. METHODS: This was a descriptive prospective study which was conducted at Bugando Medical Centre between March 2009 and February 2013. All patients with a clinical diagnosis of gastric outlet obstruction were, after informed consent for the study, consecutively enrolled into the study. Statistical data analysis was done using SPSS computer software version 17.0. RESULTS: A total of 184 patients were studied. More than two-third of patients were males. Patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction were older than those of benign type. This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Gastric cancer was the commonest malignant cause of gastric outlet obstruction where as peptic ulcer disease was the commonest benign cause. In children, the commonest cause of gastric outlet obstruction was congenital pyloric stenosis (13.0%). Non-bilious vomiting (100%) and weight loss (93.5%) were the most frequent symptoms. Eighteen (9.8%) patients were HIV positive with the median CD 4+ count of 282 cells/mul. A total of 168 (91.3%) patients underwent surgery. Of these, gastro-jejunostomy (61.9%) was the most common surgical procedure performed. The complication rate was 32.1 % mainly surgical site infections (38.2%). The median hospital stay and mortality rate were 14 days and 18.5% respectively. The presence of postoperative complication was the main predictor of hospital stay (p = 0.002), whereas the age > 60 years, co-existing medical illness, malignant cause, HIV positivity, low CD 4 count (<200 cells/mul), high ASA class and presence of surgical site infection significantly predicted mortality ( p< 0.001). The follow up of patients was generally poor as more than 60% of patients were lost to follow up. CONCLUSION: Gastric outlet obstruction in our setting is more prevalent in males and the cause is mostly malignant. The majority of patients present late with poor general condition. Early recognition of the diagnosis, aggressive resuscitation and early institution of surgical management is of paramount importance if morbidity and mortality associated with gastric outlet obstruction are to be avoided.</td>

      <td>Task-sharing of HIV care and ART initiation: evaluation of a mixed-care non-physician provider model for ART delivery in rural Malawi.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Expanding access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa requires implementation of alternative care delivery models to traditional physician-centered approaches. This longitudinal analysis compares outcomes of patients initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART) by non-physician and physician providers. METHODS: Adults (>/=15 years) initiating ART between September 2007 and March 2010, and with >1 follow-up visit were included and classified according to the proportion of clinical visits performed by nurses or by clinical officers (>/= 80% of visits). Multivariable Poisson models were used to compare 2-year program attrition (mortality and lost to follow-up) and mortality by type of provider. In sensitivity analyses only patients with less severe disease were included. RESULTS: A total of 10,112 patients contributed 14,012 person-years to the analysis: 3386 (33.5%) in the clinical officer group, 1901 (18.8%) in the nurse care group and 4825 (47.7%) in the mixed care group. Overall 2-year program retention was 81.8%. Attrition was lower in the mixed care and higher in the clinical officer group, compared to the nurse group (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR]=0.54, 95%CI 0.45-0.65; and aIRR=3.03, 95%CI 2.56-3.59, respectively). While patients initiated on ART by clinical officers in the mixed care group had lower attrition (aIRR=0.36, 95%CI 0.29-0.44) than those in the overall nurse care group; no differences in attrition were found between patients initiated on ART by nurses in the mixed care group and those included in the nurse group (aIRR=1.18, 95%CI 0.95-1.47). Two-year mortality estimates were aIRR=0.72, 95%CI 0.49-1.09 and aIRR=5.04, 95%CI 3.56-7.15, respectively. Slightly higher estimates were observed when analyses were restricted to patients with less severe disease. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study support the use of a mixed care model with well trained and regularly supervised nurses and medical assistants to provide HIV care in countries with high HIV prevalence.</td>

      <td>High treatment success in children treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: an observational cohort study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Few studies have described the management of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) in children and evidence-based guidance on management is lacking. We describe the presentation, treatment and outcome in children treated for severe and non-severe MDR-TB in Cape Town, South Africa. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study of all children (<15 years) treated for MDR-TB if routinely initiated on treatment between January 2009 and December 2010. Treatment was based on local standard of care, based on international guidelines. Data were collected through family interviews and folder review. Standardised definitions were used for diagnosis, severity of disease, adverse events and outcome. RESULTS: Of 149 children started on MDR-TB treatment, the median age was 36 months (IQR 16-66), 32 (22%; of 146 tested) had HIV infection and 59 (40%) had a confirmed diagnosis. Ninety-four (66%) children were treated with an injectable drug and the median total duration of treatment was 13 months (IQR 11-18). Thirty-six (24%) children were cured, 101 (68%) probably cured, 1 (1%) was transferred out, 8 (5%) were lost to follow-up and 3 (2%) died. Children with severe disease were older (54 months (IQR 18-142) vs 31.5 months (IQR 17.5-53.5); p=0.012), more commonly had HIV infection (OR 6.25; 95% CI 2.50 to 15.6; p<0.001) and were more likely to die (p=0.008). DISCUSSION: A confirmed diagnosis of MDR-TB is not possible in all cases but this should not impede the treatment of MDR-TB in children. More than 90% of children with MDR-TB can be successfully treated. Non-severe disease could be successfully treated with reduced treatment duration.</td>

We conducted this study to determine the pattern of efavirenz and nevirapine plasma drug concentrations among adult HIV-infected patients with immunological failure attending at a tertiary hospital in North-western Tanzania. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among adult HIV-infected patients with immunological failure who have been on either efavirenz or nevirapine based antiretroviral regimen for more than 6 months. Patients were serially enrolled through routine Care and Treatment Clinic (CTC) activities. Plasma drug concentrations for efavirenz and nevirapine were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Gas Chromatography (GC) respectively. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data such as viral load and CD4 counts were collected. Data analysis was done using STATA 12. RESULTS: Of the 152 patients with immunological failure enrolled, the sub-therapeutic, therapeutic and supra-therapeutic plasma antiretroviral drug concentrations were found in 43/152 (28.3%), 76/152 (50.0%) and 33/152 (21.7%) respectively. Half of the patients were outside therapeutic window with either sub-therapeutic or supra-therapeutic plasma ARV drug concentrations. There was a significant difference in distribution of ARV adherence (p-value<0.001), NRTI backbone (p-value = 0.039), HIV stage (p-value = 0.026) and viral load (p-value = 0.007) within sub-therapeutic, therapeutic and supra-therapeutic ARV plasma drug concentrations. CONCLUSION: There is a wide inter-individual variability of plasma ARV concentrations among HIV patients with immunological failure, with a large proportion of patients being outside therapeutic window. This variability is significant based on ARV adherence, NRTI backbone, viral load and HIV stage. Routine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) could assist identifying these patients early and making timely correction to avoid virological failure, poor immunological outcome and prevent associated drug toxicities. Nonetheless, ARV adherence should be strictly emphasized on HIV patients with immunological failure.</td>

      <td>The magnitude of loss to follow-up of HIV-exposed infants along the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission continuum of care: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Although prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) programs are widely implemented, many children do not benefit from them because of loss to follow-up (LTFU). We conducted a systematic review to determine the magnitude of infant/baby LTFU along the PMTCT cascade. METHODS: Eligible publications reported infant LTFU outcomes from standard care PMTCT programs (not intervention studies) at any stage of the cascade. Literature searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, Web of Knowledge, CINAHL Plus, and Maternity and Infant Care. Extracted data included setting, methods of follow-up, PMTCT regimens, and proportion and timing of LTFU. For programs in sub-Saharan Africa, random-effects meta-analysis was done using Stata v10. Because of heterogeneity, predictive intervals (PrIs; approximate 95% confidence intervals of a future study based on extent of observed heterogeneity) were computed. RESULTS: A total of 826 papers were identified; 25 publications were eligible. Studies were published from 2001 to 2012 and were mostly from sub-Saharan Africa (three were from India, one from UK and one from Ireland). There was extensive heterogeneity in findings. Eight studies reported on LTFU of pregnant HIV-positive women between antenatal care (ANC) registration and delivery, which ranged from 10.9 to 68.1%, pooled proportion 49.08% [95% confidence interval (CI) 39.6-60.9%], and PrI 22.0-100%. Fourteen studies reported LTFU of infants within 3 months of delivery, range 4.8-75%, pooled proportion 33.9% (27.6-41.5), and PrI 15.4-74.2. Children were also lost after HIV testing; this was reported in five studies, pooled estimate 45.5% (35.9-57.6), PrI 18.7-100%. Programs that actively tracked defaulters had better retention outcomes. CONCLUSION: There is unacceptable infant LTFU from PMTCT programs. Countries should incorporate defaulter-tracking as standard to improve retention.</td>

      <td>HIV-1 drug resistance in recently HIV-infected pregnant mother's naive to antiretroviral therapy in Dodoma urban, Tanzania.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: HIV resistance affects virological response to therapy and efficacy of prophylaxis in mother-to-child-transmission. The study aims to assess the prevalence of HIV primary resistance in pregnant women naive to antiretrovirals. METHODS: Cross sectional baseline analysis of a cohort of HIV + pregnant women (HPW) enrolled in the study entitled Antiretroviral Management of Antenatal and Natal HIV Infection (AMANI, peace in Kiswahili language). The AMANI study began in May 2010 in Dodoma, Tanzania. In this observational cohort, antiretroviral treatment was provided to all women from the 28th week of gestation until the end of the breastfeeding period. Baseline CD4 cell count, viral load and HIV drug-resistance genotype were collected. RESULTS: Drug-resistance analysis was performed on 97 naive infected-mothers. The prevalence of all primary drug resistance and primary non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors resistance was 11.9% and 7.5%, respectively. K103S was found in two women with no M184V detection. HIV-1 subtype A was the most commonly identified, with a high prevalence of subtype A1, followed by C, D, C/D recombinant, A/C recombinant and A/D recombinant. HIV drug- resistance mutations were detected in A1 and C subtypes. CONCLUSION: Our study reports an 11.9% prevalence rate of primary drug resistance in naive HIV-infected pregnant women from a remote area of Tanzania. Considering that the non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors are part of the first-line antiretroviral regimen in Tanzania and all of Africa, resistance surveys should be prioritized in settings where antiretroviral therapy programs are scaled up.</td>

      <td>Multidrug-resistant TB in Zambia: review of national data from 2000 to 2011.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is posing a great threat to global TB control. The burden in Zambia is not well defined because routine surveillance data are scarce. We reviewed national MDR-TB data for the last decade to inform future public health policy with respect to MDR-TB in Zambia. METHOD: Retrospective review of national surveillance of MDR-TB data, TB programme and laboratory reports between 2000 and 2011. RESULTS: The total number of DSTs performed during this 11-year period was 2,038 and accounted for 2.6% (2,038/78,639) of all the retreatment cases notified. The total number of diagnosed MDR-TB cases for this period was 446, of which 56.3% (251/446) were male and 41.7% (186/446) female. Only one child was found to have MDR-TB. Poly-drug resistance accounted for 18.9% (172/911) of the DR-TB cases and 8.4% of the total DSTs. 8.8% (80/911) of the DR-TB cases showed either rifampicin mono- or poly-resistance other than MDR-TB. No XDR-TB was reported. There were no data available on DR-TB and HIV co-infection. Only 65 MDR-TB patients were notified and put on second-line treatment according to WHO guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis may be an emerging challenge in Zambia. There is a need to invest in improving the capacity of the TB programme to detect and manage MDR-TB.</td>

      <td>Comparing the effectiveness of efavirenz and nevirapine for first-line antiretroviral therapy in a South African multicentre cohort.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Current WHO guidelines for developing countries recommend efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP) for first-line antiretroviral treatment (ART). This paper compares the effectiveness of EFV and NVP among ART-naive patients initiating treatment at 56 public health facilities in South Africa between January 2004 and December 2007. METHODS: Participants were assigned to the EFV or NVP cohorts depending on their baseline ART regimen. Mortality, viral load suppression after 6 months and ART regimen change were compared between the cohorts using Cox proportional hazards models and logistic regression. RESULTS: At initiation, 19 441 (71.1%) patients started EFV and 7909 (28.9%) started NVP treatment. The median follow-up period was 9.5 months (IQR 4.6-17.7). After adjustment, mortality was similar in the two cohorts, (adjusted HR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.89-1.28). Viral load suppression at 6 months was higher in the EFV cohort overall (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.29, 95% CI 1.05-1.59) and in women aged 16-40 years (AOR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.11-1.63) and women with CD4 counts <25 cells/microL (AOR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.01-3.76). Patients starting on EFV were 47% less likely to change regimen (AOR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.48-0.59). DISCUSSION: These findings suggest the superior effectiveness of EFV for first-line ART compared with NVP and should be considered during development of future ART guidelines for high-burden regions.</td>

      <td>Factors associated with attrition, mortality, and loss to follow up after antiretroviral therapy initiation: data from an HIV cohort study in India.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Studies from sub-Saharan Africa have shown high incidence of attrition due to mortality or loss to follow-up (LTFU) after initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). India is the third largest country in the world in terms of HIV infected people, but predictors of attrition after ART initiation are not well known. DESIGN: We describe factors associated with attrition, mortality, and LTFU in 3,159 HIV infected patients who initiated ART between 1 January 2007 and 4 November 2011 in an HIV cohort study in India. The study included 6,852 person-years with a mean follow-up of 2.17 years. RESULTS: After 5 years of follow-up, the estimated cumulative incidence of attrition was 37.7%. There was no significant difference between attrition due to mortality and attrition due to LTFU. Having CD4 counts <100 cells/microl and being homeless [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 3.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.6-3.8] were associated with a higher risk of attrition, and female gender (aHR 0.64, 95% CI 0.6-0.8) was associated with a reduced risk of attrition. Living near a town (aHR 0.82, 95% CI 0.7-0.999) was associated with a reduced risk of mortality. Being single (aHR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.3), illiteracy (aHR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6), and age <25 years (aHR 1.3, 95% CI 1-1.8) were associated with an increased risk of LTFU. Although the cumulative incidence of attrition in patients diagnosed with tuberculosis after ART initiation was 47.4%, patients who started anti-tuberculous treatment before ART had similar attrition to patients without tuberculosis (36 vs. 35.2%, P=0.19) after four years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort study, the attrition was similar to the one found in sub-Saharan Africa. Earlier initiation of ART, improving the diagnosis of tuberculosis before initiating ART, and giving more support to those patients at higher risk of attrition could potentially reduce the mortality and LTFU after ART initiation.</td>

      <td>Outcomes in HIV-infected adults with tuberculosis at clinics with and without co-located HIV clinics in Botswana.</td>
      <td>SETTING: Gaborone, Botswana. OBJECTIVE: To determine if starting anti-tuberculosis treatment at clinics in Gaborone without co-located human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clinics would delay time to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation and be associated with lower survival compared to starting anti-tuberculosis treatment at clinics with on-site HIV clinics. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. Subjects were HAART-naive, aged >/= 21 years with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), HIV and CD4 counts </= 250 cells/mm(3) initiating anti-tuberculosis treatment between 2005 and 2010. Survival at completion of anti-tuberculosis treatment or at 6 months post-treatment initiation and time to HAART after anti-tuberculosis treatment initiation were compared by clinic type. RESULTS: Respectively 259 and 80 patients from clinics without and with on-site HIV facilities qualified for the study. Age, sex, CD4, baseline sputum smears and loss to follow-up rate were similar by clinic type. Mortality did not differ between clinics without or with on-site HIV clinics (20/250, 8.0% vs. 8/79, 10.1%, relative risk 0.79, 95%CI 0.36-1.72), nor did median time to HAART initiation (respectively 63 and 66 days, P = 0.53). CONCLUSION: In urban areas where TB and HIV programs are separate, geographic co-location alone without further integration may not reduce mortality or time to HAART initiation among co-infected patients.</td>

      <td>Uptake, outcomes, and costs of antenatal, well-baby, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV services under routine care conditions in Zambia.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Zambia adopted Option A for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) in 2010 and announced a move to Option B+ in 2013. We evaluated the uptake, outcomes, and costs of antenatal, well-baby, and PMTCT services under routine care conditions in Zambia after the adoption of Option A. METHODS: We enrolled 99 HIV-infected/HIV-exposed (index) mother/baby pairs with a first antenatal visit in April-September 2011 at four study sites and 99 HIV-uninfected/HIV-unexposed (comparison) mother/baby pairs matched on site, gestational age, and calendar month at first visit. Data on patient outcomes and resources utilized from the first antenatal visit through six months postpartum were extracted from site registers. Costs in 2011 USD were estimated from the provider's perspective. RESULTS: Index mothers presented for antenatal care at a mean 23.6 weeks gestation; 55% were considered to have initiated triple-drug antiretroviral therapy (ART) based on information recorded in site registers. Six months postpartum, 62% of index and 30% of comparison mother/baby pairs were retained in care; 67% of index babies retained had an unknown HIV status. Comparison and index mother/baby pairs utilized fewer resources than under fully guideline-concordant care; index babies utilized more well-baby resources than comparison babies. The average cost per comparison pair retained in care six months postpartum was $52 for antenatal and well-baby services. The average cost per index pair retained was $88 for antenatal, well-baby, and PMTCT services and increased to $185 when costs of triple-drug ART services were included. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected mothers present to care late in pregnancy and many are lost to follow up by six months postpartum. HIV-exposed babies are more likely to remain in care and receive non-HIV, well-baby care than HIV-unexposed babies. Improving retention in care, guideline concordance, and moving to Option B+ will result in increased service delivery costs in the short term.</td>

      <td>High-levels of acquired drug resistance in adult patients failing first-line antiretroviral therapy in a rural HIV treatment programme in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and patterns of acquired antiretroviral drug resistance in a rural primary health care programme in South Africa. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study nested within HIV treatment programme. METHODS: Adult (>/= 18 years) HIV-infected individuals initially treated with a first-line stavudine- or zidovudine-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen and with evidence of virological failure (one viral load >1000 copies/ml) were enrolled from 17 rural primary health care clinics. Genotypic resistance testing was performed using the in-house SATuRN/Life Technologies system. Sequences were analysed and genotypic susceptibility scores (GSS) for standard second-line regimens were calculated using the Stanford HIVDB 6.0.5 algorithms. RESULTS: A total of 222 adults were successfully genotyped for HIV drug resistance between December 2010 and March 2012. The most common regimens at time of genotype were stavudine, lamivudine and efavirenz (51%); and stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine (24%). Median duration of ART was 42 months (interquartile range (IQR) 32-53) and median duration of antiretroviral failure was 27 months (IQR 17-40). One hundred and ninety one (86%) had at least one drug resistance mutation. For 34 individuals (15%), the GSS for the standard second-line regimen was <2, suggesting a significantly compromised regimen. In univariate analysis, individuals with a prior nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) substitution were more likely to have a GSS <2 than those on the same NRTIs throughout (odds ratio (OR) 5.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.60-12.49). CONCLUSIONS: There are high levels of drug resistance in adults with failure of first-line antiretroviral therapy in this rural primary health care programme. Standard second-line regimens could potentially have had reduced efficacy in about one in seven adults involved.</td>

      <td>Hepatitis B virus in HIV-infected patients in northeastern South Africa: prevalence, exposure, protection and response to HAART.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV are endemic infections in many African countries. The objectives of this study were to determine the levels of exposure to, and protection from, HBV, as well as the prevalence of HIV/HBV co-infection and the response of HBV to highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) in a cross-section of HIV-infected patients in north-eastern South Africa. STUDY DESIGN: This was a laboratory-based, unmatched study. Three hundred and eighty patients were screened by ELISA for HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HBs. Samples non-reactive for HBsAg but reactive for anti-HBc were examined for occult HBV infection. Response to HAART was assessed by measuring HBV viral loads, seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe, and levels of aminotransferase. RESULTS: Of the study population of 380, 60% (95% CI 54.8 - 64.9) were exposed to HBV based on HBsAg, anti-HBs or anti-HBc; 20% (95% CI 16.1 - 24.4) had active HBV infection, based on HBsAg serology, and 30% (95% CI 25.2 - 35.2) were protected, based on anti-HBs levels > or = 10 IU/l. Of 181 HBsAg-negative individuals, 61 had HBV occult infection (33.7%, 95% CI 26.9 - 41.1). The differences in prevalence were not statistically significant when gender, marital status and CD4+ cell counts were considered. Of 21 patients analysed, 80% showed adequate response to the first-line HAART regimen (stavudine/lamivudine/efavirenz or nevirapine) after 12 months of use. CONCLUSION: The study confirms the higher level (60%) of exposure to HBV in HIV patients in Limpopo Province, as well as the high (20%) prevalence of HBsAg positivity and occult hepatitis B (33.7%). However, further studies are warranted to corroborate the benefit of lamivudine-containing HAART regimens, as HIV/HBV co-infected patients have a higher liver-related mortality if hepatitis B is not treated.</td>

The first episode of molluscum contagiosum IRIS occurred with rapid virologic suppression following antiretroviral therapy initiation. The second episode occurred during a rapid increase in CD4 cells following stable viral suppression with second-line antiretroviral therapy. His molluscum contagiosum lesions then completely resolved during a reduction in CD4 count, despite maintaining virologic suppression. Nearly one year after the resolution of his giant molluscum contagiosum IRIS lesions, he maintains an undetectable viral load, but his level of immune deficiency has not improved. In the absence of well-controlled therapeutic trials, molluscum contagiosum IRIS presents important management challenges.</td>

      <td>The impact of choice of NNRTI on short-term treatment outcomes among HIV-infected patients prescribed tenofovir and lamivudine in Johannesburg, South Africa.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Recent WHO guidelines for resource-limited settings recommend tenofovir in first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) yet there are suggestions that patients receiving nevirapine with tenofovir have worse outcomes than those receiving efavirenz. We sought to compare outcomes among those taking nevirapine vs. efavirenz with tenofovir and lamivudine. METHODS: We analyzed data on ART naive, non-pregnant patients, >/= 18 years old without tuberculosis co-infection, initiating tenofovir with lamivudine and either nevirapine or efavirenz between April 1, 2010 and July 31, 2011 (when South Africa's public-sector use of tenofovir began) at Themba Lethu Clinic in South Africa. We measured virologic suppression (viral load <400 copies/ml), virologic failure (2 consecutive viral loads >1000 copies/ml), and attrition (death/loss to follow-up) all at 12 months after ART initiation. Modified Poisson regression with robust error estimation was used to estimate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for predictors of each outcome. RESULTS: 2,254 patients were prescribed efavirenz, 131 nevirapine. Patients were followed a median (range) of 12.0 (0.1-12.0) person-months. 62.2% were female and median (IQR) age was 37.7 years (31.5-44.1). Patients prescribed efavirenz had similar initiating CD4 counts (median 132 for both regimens) but were somewhat more likely to be WHO Stage III or IV (39.6% vs. 33.6%) than those prescribed nevirapine. No difference in attrition was found (aRR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.49-1.41). Among patients with >/= 1 viral load within 1 year on ART, those prescribed nevirapine were as likely to reach virologic suppression (aRR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.88-1.07) but more likely to experience virologic failure (aRR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.02-3.31) than those prescribed efavirenz. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the notion that, among patients prescribed tenofovir and lamivudine, virologic failure is more common among those taking nevirapine than among those taking efavirenz. Longer-term follow up and larger studies will be needed to confirm this finding.</td>

      <td>Anti-tuberculosis drug resistance among new and previously treated sputum smear-positive tuberculosis patients in Uganda: results of the first national survey.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistant and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) have become major threats to control of tuberculosis globally. The rates of anti-TB drug resistance in Uganda are not known. We conducted a national drug resistance survey to investigate the levels and patterns of resistance to first and second line anti-TB drugs among new and previously treated sputum smear-positive TB cases. METHODS: Sputum samples were collected from a nationally representative sample of new and previously treated sputum smear-positive TB patients registered at TB diagnostic centers during December 2009 to February 2011 using a weighted cluster sampling method. Culture and drug susceptibility testing was performed at the national TB reference laboratory. RESULTS: A total of 1537 patients (1397 new and 140 previously treated) were enrolled in the survey from 44 health facilities. HIV test result and complete drug susceptibility testing (DST) results were available for 1524 (96.8%) and 1325 (85.9%) patients, respectively. Of the 1209 isolates from new cases, resistance to any anti-TB drug was 10.3%, 5% were resistant to isoniazid, 1.9% to rifampicin, and 1.4% were multi drug resistant. Among the 116 isolates from previously treated cases, the prevalence of resistance was 25.9%, 23.3%, 12.1% and 12.1% respectively. Of the 1524 patients who had HIV testing 469 (30.7%) tested positive. There was no association between anti-TB drug resistance (including MDR) and HIV infection. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of anti-TB drug resistance among new patients in Uganda is low relative to WHO estimates. The higher levels of MDR-TB (12.1%) and resistance to any drug (25.3%) among previously treated patients raises concerns about the quality of directly observed therapy (DOT) and adherence to treatment. This calls for strengthening existing TB control measures, especially DOT, routine DST among the previously treated TB patients or periodic drug resistance surveys, to prevent and monitor development and transmission of drug resistant TB.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: In Mozambique, highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) was introduced in 2004 followed by decentralization and expansion, resulting in a more than 20-fold increase in coverage by 2009. Implementation of HIV drug resistance threshold surveys (HIVDR-TS) is crucial in order to monitor the emergence of transmitted viral resistance, and to produce evidence-based recommendations to support antiretroviral (ARV) policy in Mozambique. METHODS: World Health Organization (WHO) methodology was used to evaluate transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in newly diagnosed HIV-1 infected pregnant women attending ante-natal clinics in Maputo and Beira to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and protease inhibitors (PI). Subtypes were assigned using REGA HIV-1 subtyping tool and phylogenetic trees constructed using MEGA version 5. RESULTS: Although mutations associated with resistance to all three drug were detected in these surveys, transmitted resistance was analyzed and classified as <5% in Maputo in both surveys for all three drug classes. Transmitted resistance to NNRTI in Beira in 2009 was classified between 5-15%, an increase from 2007 when no NNRTI mutations were found. All sequences clustered with subtype C. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the epidemic is dominated by subtype C, where the first-line option based on two NRTI and one NNRTI is still effective for treatment of HIV infection, but intermediate levels of TDR found in Beira reinforce the need for constant evaluation with continuing treatment expansion in Mozambique.</td>

      <td>Short communication: Late refills during the first year of antiretroviral therapy predict mortality and program failure among HIV-infected adults in urban Zambia.</td>
      <td>We evaluated the association of the number of late antiretroviral therapy (ART) refills with patient outcomes in a large public-sector human immunodeficiency virus treatment program in Lusaka, Zambia. Using pharmacy data routinely collected during 2004-2010, we calculated the number of late refills during the initial year of ART. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression to examine the association between the number of late refills and death or program failure (i.e., death, loss to follow-up, or program withdrawal) >12 months after ART initiation, with and without stratification by the medication possession ratio (MPR) during the initial year of ART. Of 53,015 adults who received ART for >/=12 months (median follow-up duration, 86.1 months; interquartile range, 53.2-128.2 months), 26,847 (50.6%) had 0 late refills, 16,762 (31.6%) had 1, 6,505 (12.3%) had 2, and 2,901 (5.5%) had >/=3. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that >/=3 late refills was associated with a greater mortality risk than 1 and 2 late refills (p<0.001, by the log-rank test). The mortality risk was greater for patients with 2 late refills [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.99-1.38] or >/=3 late refills (adjusted HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.23-1.87), compared with that for patients with 0-1 late refills. Program failure was associated with >/=2 late refills. An MPR of <80% was associated with similar increases in mortality risk across late-refill strata. Monitoring late refills during the initial period of ART may help resource- and time-constrained clinics identify patients at risk for program failure.</td>

      <td>Averted HIV infections due to expanded antiretroviral treatment eligibility offsets risk of transmitted drug resistance: a modeling study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Earlier antiretroviral therapy initiation can reduce the incidence of HIV-1. This benefit can be offset by increased transmitted drug resistance (TDR). We compared the preventive benefits of reducing incident infections with the potential TDR increase in East Africa. METHODS: A mathematical model was constructed to represent Kampala, Uganda, and Mombasa, Kenya. We predicted the effect of initiating treatment at different immunological thresholds (<350, <500 CD4 cells/mul) on infections averted and mutation-specific TDR prevalence over 10 years compared to initiating treatment at CD4 cell count below 200 cells/mul. RESULTS: When initiating treatment at CD4 cell count below 350 cells/mul, we predict 18 [interquartile range (IQR) 11-31] and 46 (IQR 30-83) infections averted for each additional case of TDR in Kampala and Mombasa, respectively, and 22 (IQR 17-35) and 32 (IQR 21-57) infections averted when initiating at below 500. TDR is predicted to increase most strongly when initiating treatment at CD4 cell count below 500 cells/mul, from 8.3% (IQR 7.7-9.0%) and 12.3% (IQR 11.7-13.1%) in 2012 to 19.0% (IQR 16.5-21.8%) and 19.2% (IQR 17.1-21.5%) in 10 years in Kampala and Mombasa, respectively. The TDR epidemic at all immunological thresholds was comprised mainly of resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. When 80-100% of individuals with virological failure are timely switched to second-line therapy, TDR is predicted to decline irrespective of treatment initiation threshold. CONCLUSION: Averted HIV infections due to the expansion of antiretroviral treatment eligibility offset the risk of transmitted drug resistance, as defined by more infections averted than TDR gained. The effectiveness of first-line non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based therapy can be preserved by improving switching practices to second-line therapy.</td>

      <td>Bone mineral density in HIV participants randomized to raltegravir and lopinavir/ritonavir compared with standard second line therapy.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To compare changes over 48 weeks in bone mineral density (BMD) between participants randomized to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) + raltegravir (RAL) or LPV/r + 2-3 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N(t)RTIs) as second line therapy. DESIGN: 48-week open-label sub-study of the Second Line trial conducted in South Africa, India, Thailand, Malaysia and Argentina. METHODS: Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scans of proximal femur and lumbar spine were performed at baseline and week 48. Linear regression was used to compare means of differences between arms. McNemars test compared osteopenia and osteoporosis. Associations between percentage BMD changes and baseline variables were assessed by multivariate linear regression. RESULTS: Two hundred and ten participants were randomized. Analyses were adjusted for sex, BMI and smoking status. Mean (95% CI) proximal femur BMD% reduced over 48 weeks by -5.2% (-6.7 to -3.8%) in the LPV/r+2-3N(t)RTIs arm and by -2.9% (-4.3 to -1.5%) in the LPV/r+RAL arm (P = 0.0001). Lumbar spine BMD reduced by -4.2% (-5.7 to -2.7%) in the LPV/r+2-3N(t)RTIs arm and by -2.0% (-3.5 to -0.6%) in the LPV/r+RAL arm (P = 0.0006). The incidence of osteopenia (7.6%) and osteoporosis (2.0%) assessed over 48 weeks were similar between arms. Reduced BMD over 48 weeks was significantly associated with longer duration of tenofovir on study [% change (SE) -1.58 (0.38) femur, -1.65 (0.38) spine, P = 0.0001] and low baseline BMI [% change (SE) 0.5 (0.13) femur, 0.17 (0.07) spine; P < 0.01]. CONCLUSION: An N(t)RTI-sparing antiretroviral regimen of LPV/r and raltegravir as second line therapy is associated with less bone loss than a LPV/r regimen containing N(t)RTIs.</td>

      <td>Adverse events during treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis: a comparison between patients with or without human immunodeficiency virus co-infection.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: In settings such as Namibia with a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and drug-resistant (DR) tuberculosis (TB) co-infection, interactions and adverse events associated with second-line anti-TB and antiretroviral medicines pose a unique challenge in the treatment of both infections. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to compare the absolute risks and risk factors for commonly observed adverse events (occurring in >20 % of patients) during DR-TB treatment in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of patients treated for DR-TB between January 2008 and February 2010 at the Kondja DR-TB ward in Walvis Bay, Namibia. Data were anonymously collected from patients' treatment records, using a structured form. The data were then analyzed using descriptive statistics, while 2 x 2 contingency tables stratified by HIV status were employed to examine specific risk factor and adverse event relationships, using Epi Info 3.4.3 statistical software. Eighteen adverse events were studied but, because of the small sample size of patients, only the four most frequent ones (occurring in >20 % of patients) were included in the risk factor analysis. The risk factors were a treatment period of <4 weeks; treatment with any highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen; specific treatment with a zidovudine (AZT)-based HAART regimen, a cycloserine-based DR-TB regimen or an amikacin-based DR-TB regimen; female gender; baseline body weight </= 45 kg; and age 30 >/= years. RESULTS: Of the 57 DR-TB patients who were included in the analysis, 31 (53 %) were co-infected with HIV. When stratified by HIV status, DR-TB patients had similar exposure to specific DR-TB medicines and comparable demographic and clinical characteristics, except for age, as HIV-infected patients were on average 6.5 years older than HIV-uninfected patients (P = 0.007). Of the 18 studied adverse events, tinnitus (40 %), joint pain (26 %), hearing loss (23 %) and nausea (21 %) were the four most commonly observed events. Only for abdominal pain was there a statistically significant difference in the risk of occurrence between HIV-infected patients and HIV-uninfected patients (26 versus 4 %, P = 0.02). The risk ratios (RRs) for the association between treatment with a cycloserine-based DR-TB regimen and occurrence of joint pain did not differ much between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients (RR 4.3 in HIV-infected patients, P = 0.03; RR 5 in HIV-uninfected patients, P = 0.08). Similarly, although some differences in the RRs were observed between the two HIV status groups, the differences were not statistically significant for tinnitus, hearing loss or nausea. In some instances, HIV status appeared to modify the effect of the association of some of the risk factors and adverse event occurrence, but the wide and overlapping confidence intervals were inconclusive. CONCLUSION: Generally, the absolute risks and risk factors for adverse events were similar between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients treated for DR-TB in our Namibian cohort of 57 patients. Although our findings of comparable adverse event risks between DR-TB and DR-TB/HIV co-infected patients are encouraging, they are inconclusive because of the low statistical power of our study. We recommend a prospective study with a larger sample size that would increase the power and therefore the confidence in the results.</td>

      <td>High retention in care among HIV-infected patients entering care with CD4 levels >350 cells/muL under routine program conditions in Uganda.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In Africa, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who present to care with CD4 levels >350 cells/microL (ie, current antiretroviral treatment thresholds) are often thought to be poorly retained in care, but most estimates do not account for outcomes among patients lost to follow-up. METHODS: We evaluated HIV-infected adults who had made a visit in the last 2.5 years in a program in Uganda. We identified a random sample of patients lost to follow-up (9 months without a visit). Ascertainers sought patients in the community in this sample and outcomes were incorporated into revised survival estimates of mortality and retention for the clinic population using a probability weight. RESULTS: Of 6473 patients, (29% male, median age 29 years, median CD4 count 550 cells/microL), 1294 (20%) became lost to follow-up over 2.5 years. Two hundred seven (16%) randomly selected lost patients were sought, and in 175 (85%) vital status was ascertained. In 19 of 175 (11%), the patient had died. Of the 156 (89%) alive, 74 (47%) were interviewed in person, and 38 of 74 (51%) reported HIV care elsewhere, whereas 36 of 74 (49%) were not in care. Application of weights derived from sampling found that at 2.5 years, retention among patients who enrolled with CD4 levels >350 cells/microL was 88.2% and mortality was 2.5%. Lower income, unemployment, and rural residence were associated with failure to be retained. CONCLUSIONS: Retention in patients entering care with high CD4 counts under routine program conditions in Africa is high in a Ugandan care program and may be systematically underestimated in many other settings.</td>

      <td>Adults receiving HIV care before the start of antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa: patient outcomes and associated risk factors.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Gaining understanding of the period before antiretroviral therapy (ART) is needed to improve treatment outcomes and to reduce HIV transmission. This study describes the cascade of enrollment in HIV care, pre-ART follow-up, and predictors of mortality and lost to follow-up (LTFU) before ART initiation. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study among HIV-infected adult patients not yet started on ART in 4 HIV Sub-Saharan African programs. Patient follow-up began at enrollment and ended at the earliest of death, transfer-out, ART initiation, last visit date, or 60 months postenrollment. Risk factors for death and LTFU were investigated during the periods 0-6 and 6-60 months. RESULTS: A total of 55,789 patients (65.4% women) were included as follows: 44.2% in clinical stage 3 or 4, with median CD4 of 261 cells per microliter [interquartile range (IQR): 125-447]. Patient care started with a median of 3 days (IQR: 0-11) after HIV diagnosis, and 31,104 of 55,789 (55.8%) patients had CD4 counts performed within 1 month of enrollment. Of 47,283 patients with known ART eligibility status at enrollment, 36,969 (78.2%) patients required ART and 27,798 of 36,969 (75.7%) patients initiated therapy. Median follow-up was 2.5 months (IQR: 0.9-13.1). Mortality and LTFU rates were 3.9 per 100 person-years [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.7 to 4.1] and 28.3 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 27.8 to 28.8), respectively. Regardless of period, increased mortality and LTFU were associated with male, lower body mass index, advanced clinical stage, and lower CD4 cell count. CONCLUSIONS: Short delays between HIV testing and care enrollment were observed in our HIV programs, but delays to determine ART eligibility were long. Interventions to initiate ART earlier, specifically targeted to men, are needed to improve patient retention in Africa.</td>

      <td>HIV-HBV coinfection in Southern Africa and the effect of lamivudine- versus tenofovir-containing cART on HBV outcomes.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: This study assessed HIV-hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection in southern Africa in terms of prevalence, viral characteristics, occult HBV, and the effect of lamivudine- versus tenofovir-containing first-line combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) on HBV-related outcomes. METHODS: A multicenter prospective cohort of HIV-infected adults in Zambia and South Africa who initiated cART. Outcomes by month 12 on cART were immunological recovery, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss, viral suppression, and drug resistance. We used descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and linear mixed models. RESULTS: Of the 1087 participants, 92 were HBsAg seropositive, yielding a sample-weighted prevalence of 7.4% (95% confidence interval: 5.6 to 9.2), with 76% genotype HBV-A1. The estimated CD4 recovery on cART was similar between HIV monoinfection and HIV-HBV coinfection groups and between lamivudine- and tenofovir-treated participants. HBsAg loss was documented in 20% (4/20) of lamivudine-treated and 18% (3/17) of tenofovir-treated participants (P = 0.305). Viral suppression (HBV-DNA < 20 IU/mL) was achieved in 61.5% (16/26) of lamivudine-treated and 71.4% (15/21) of tenofovir-treated participants (P = 0.477). HBV pol sequencing demonstrated M204I (n = 3) and N236T (n = 1) resistance-associated mutations in 4 of 8 (50%) lamivudine-treated participants and none in tenofovir-treated participants. Occult HBV infection was present in 13.3% before cART, but by month 12, HBV-DNA was below the limit of detection (<15 IU/mL) in 90.5% (19/21) of lamivudine-treated and 100% (18/18) of tenofovir-treated participants (P = 0.179). CONCLUSIONS: Tenofovir-containing first-line cART is preferred for HIV-HBV coinfection in Africa because of a superior resistance profile relative to lamivudine monotherapy. Extended follow-up will be needed to determine long-term complications of occult HBV coinfection. Improved access to HBsAg screening and tenofovir is needed.</td>

      <td>Burden of tuberculosis disease among adolescents in a rural cohort in Eastern Uganda.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The world health organization (WHO) declared tuberculosis (TB) a global emergency, mainly affecting people in sub-Saharan Africa. However there is little data about the burden of TB among adolescents. We estimated the prevalence and incidence of TB and assessed factors associated with TB among adolescents aged 12-18 years in a rural population in Uganda in order to prepare the site for phase III clinical trials with novel TB vaccines among adolescents. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, we recruited 5000 adolescents and followed them actively, every 6 months, for 1-2 years. Participants suspected of having TB were those who had any of; TB signs and symptoms, history of TB contact or a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) of >/=10 mm. Laboratory investigations included sputum smear microscopy and culture. RESULTS: Of the 5000 participants, eight culture confirmed cases of TB were found at baseline: a prevalence of 160/100,000 (95% confidence interval (CI), 69-315). There were 13 incident TB cases detected in an average of 1.1 person years: an incidence of 235/100,000 person years (95% CI, 125-402). None of the confirmed TB cases were HIV infected. Predictors for prevalent TB disease were: a history of TB contact and a cough >/= 2 weeks at baseline and being out of school, while the only predictor for incident TB was a positive TST during follow-up. CONCLUSION: The TB incidence among adolescents in this rural part of Uganda seemed too low for a phase III TB vaccine trial. However, the study site demonstrated capability to handle a large number of participants with minimal loss to follow-up and its suitability for future clinical trials. Improved contact tracing in TB program activities is likely to increase TB case detection among adolescents. Future studies should explore possible pockets of higher TB incidence in urban areas and among out of school youth.</td>

      <td>Understanding orphan and non-orphan adolescents' sexual risks in the context of poverty: a qualitative study in Nyanza Province, Kenya.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Some studies show orphanhood to be associated with increased sexual risk-taking while others have not established this relationship, but have found factors other than orphanhood as predictors of sexual risk behaviours and outcomes among adolescents. This study examines community members' perceptions of how poverty influences adolescent sexual behaviour and outcomes in four districts of Nyanza Province, Kenya. METHODS: Eight study sites within the four districts were randomly selected. Focus group discussions were conducted with a purposive sample of adolescents, parents and caregivers. Key informant interviews were undertaken with a purposive sample of community leaders, child welfare and healthcare workers, and adolescents. The two methods elicited information on factors perceived to predispose adolescent orphans and non-orphans to sexual risks. Data were analysed through line-by-line coding, grouped into families and retrieved as themes and sub-themes. RESULTS: Participants included 147 adolescents and parents/caregivers in 14 focus groups and 13 key informants. Poverty emerged as a key predisposing factor to sexual risk behaviour among orphans and non-orphans. Poverty was associated with lack of food, poor housing, school dropout, and engaging in income generating activities, all of which increase their vulnerability to transactional sex, early marriage, sexual experimentation, and the eventual consequences of increased risk of unintended pregnancies and STI/HIV. CONCLUSION: Poverty was perceived to contribute to increasing sexual risks among orphan and non-orphan adolescents through survival strategies adopted to be able to meet their basic needs. Policies for prevention and intervention that target adolescents in a generalized poverty and HIV epidemic should integrate economic empowerment for caregivers and life skills for adolescents to reduce vulnerabilities of orphan and non-orphan adolescents to sexual risk behaviour.</td>

      <td>Poor early virologic performance and durability of abacavir-based first-line regimens for HIV-infected children.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Concerns about stavudine (d4T) toxicity have led to increased use of abacavir (ABC) in first-line pediatric antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens. Field experience with ABC in ART-naive children is limited. METHODS: Deidentified demographic, clinical and laboratory data on HIV-infected children initiating ART between 2004 and 2011 in a large pediatric HIV treatment program in Johannesburg, South Africa, were used to compare viral suppression at 6 and 12 months by initial treatment regimen, time to suppression (<400 copies/mL) and rebound (>1000 copies/mL after initial suppression). Adjusted logistic regression was used to investigate confounders and calendar effects. RESULTS: Two thousand thirty-six children initiated either d4T/3TC- or ABC/3TC-based first-line regimens in combination with either boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) or efavirenz (EFV). 1634 received d4T regimens (LPV/r n = 672; EFV n = 962) and 402 ABC regimens (LPV/r n = 192; EFV n = 210). At 6 and 12 months on ART, viral suppression rate was poorer in ABC versus d4T groups within both the LPV/r and EFV groups (P < 0.0001 for all points). In ABC groups, time to suppression was significantly slower (log-rank P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0092 for LPV/r- and EFV-based, respectively) and time to rebound after suppression significantly faster (log-rank P = 0.014 and P = 0.0001 for LPV/r- and EFV-based, respectively). Logistic regression confirmed the worse outcomes in the ABC groups even after adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSION: Data from this urban pediatric ART service program show significantly poorer virological performance of ABC compared with d4T-based regimens, a signal that urgently warrants further investigation.</td>

      <td>Comparative durability of nevirapine versus efavirenz in first-line regimens during the first year of initiating antiretroviral therapy among Swaziland HIV-infected adults.</td>
      <td>Nevirapine (NVP) and Efavirenz (EFV) have generally comparable clinical and virologic efficacy. However, data comparing NVP durability to EFV are imprecise. We analyzed cohort data to compare durability of NVP to EFV among patients initiating ART in Mbabane, Swaziland. The primary outcome was poor regimen durability defined as any modification of NVP or EFV to the ART regimen. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were employed to estimate the risk of poor regimen durability (all-cause) for the two regimens and also separately to estimate risk of drug-related toxicity. We analyzed records for 769 patients initiating ART in Mbabane, Swaziland from March 2006 to December 2007. 30 patients (3.9%) changed their NVP or EFV-based regimen during follow up. Cumulative incidence for poor regimen durability was 5.3% and 2.7% for NVP and EFV, respectively. Cumulative incidence for drug-related toxicity was 1.9% and 2.7% for NVP and EFV, respectively. Burden of TB was high and 14 (46.7%) modifications were due to patients substituting NVP due to beginning TB treatment. Though the estimates were imprecise, use of NVP - based regimens seemed to be associated with higher risk of modifications compared to use of EFV - based regimens (HR 2.03 95%CI 0.58 - 7.05) and NVP - based regimens had a small advantage over EFV - based regimens with regard to toxicity - related modifications (HR 0.87 95%CI 0.26 - 2.90). Due to the high burden of TB and a significant proportion of patients changing their ART regimen after starting TB treatment, use of EFV as the preferred NNRTI over NVP in high TB endemic settings may result in improved first-line regimen tolerance. Further studies comparing the cost-effectiveness of delivering these two NNRTIs in light of their different limitations are required.</td>

DESIGN: Descriptive cohort study. METHODS: From 1996 to 2012, all paediatric HIV clinics in the Netherlands provided data on their HIV-infected population. Descriptive statistics, parametric and non-parametric comparative tests, and random-effects linear regression models were performed to investigate the different aspects of this cohort. RESULTS: A total of 229 vertically HIV-infected children were included. The majority of all mothers (64%) and almost half of the children (43%) originated from sub-Saharan Africa. Ritonavir-boosted lopinavir and efavirenz have replaced indinavir, nelfinavir and nevirapine as preferred first-line cART regimens. Long-term CD4 T-cell reconstitution (with CD4 cell counts corrected for age) was independent of age and CD4 cell count at cART initiation. The decline in HIV viral load after cART introduction occurred faster over the studied time period. The percentage of children with an undetectable viral load rose substantially from 1996 to 2012. Mortality was 0.3 per 100 person-years. CONCLUSION: A sustained immunological response in the Dutch paediatric HIV-infected population was independent of age as well as CD4 cell count at cART initiation, despite a higher initial HIV viral load in the youngest children. The percentage of children with an undetectable HIV viral load rose substantially over the years and there was a low mortality rate in comparison with reports from other industrialized countries.</td>

      <td>A prospective longitudinal study of the clinical outcomes from cryptococcal meningitis following treatment induction with 800 mg oral fluconazole in Blantyre, Malawi.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common neurological infection in HIV infected patients in Sub Saharan Africa, where gold standard treatment with intravenous amphotericin B and 5 flucytosine is often unavailable or difficult to administer. Fluconazole monotherapy is frequently recommended in national guidelines but is a fungistatic drug compromised by uncertainty over optimal dosing and a paucity of clinical end-point outcome data. METHODS: From July 2010 until March 2011, HIV infected adults with a first episode of cryptococcal meningitis were recruited at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi. Patients were treated with oral fluconazole monotherapy 800 mg daily, as per national guidelines. ART was started at 4 weeks. Outcomes and factors associated with treatment failure were assessed 4, 10 and 52 weeks after fluconazole initiation. RESULTS: Sixty patients were recruited. 26/60 (43%) died by 4 weeks. 35/60 (58.0%) and 43/56 (77%) died or failed treatment by 10 or 52 weeks respectively. Reduced consciousness (Glasgow Coma Score <14 of 15), moderate/severe neurological disability (modified Rankin Score >3 of 5) and confusion (Abbreviated Mental Test Score <8 of 10) were all common at baseline and associated with death or treatment failure. ART prior to recruitment was not associated with better outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality and treatment failure from cryptococcal meningitis following initiation of treatment with 800 mg oral fluconazole is unacceptably high. To improve outcomes, there is an urgent need for better therapeutic strategies and point-of-care diagnostics, allowing earlier diagnosis before development of neurological deficit.</td>

      <td>Non-physician clinician provided HIV treatment results in equivalent outcomes as physician-provided care: a meta-analysis.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: A severe healthcare worker shortage in sub-Saharan Africa is inhibiting the expansion of HIV treatment. Task shifting, the transfer of antiretroviral therapy (ART) management and initiation from doctors to nurses and other non-physician clinicians, has been proposed to address this problem. However, many health officials remain wary about implementing task shifting policies due to concerns that non-physicians will provide care inferior to physicians. To determine if non-physician-provided HIV care does result in equivalent outcomes to physician-provided care, a meta-analysis was performed. METHODS: Online databases were searched using a predefined strategy. The results for four primary outcomes were combined using a random effects model with sub-groups of non-physician-managed ART and -initiated ART. TB diagnosis rates, adherence, weight gain and patient satisfaction were summarized qualitatively. RESULTS: Mortality (N=59,666) had similar outcomes for non-physicians and physicians, with a hazard ratio of 1.05 (CI: 0.88-1.26). The increase in CD4 levels at one year, as a difference in means of 2.3 (N=17,142, CI: -12.7-17.3), and viral failure at one year, as a risk ratio of 0.89 (N=10,344, CI: 0.65-1.23), were similar for physicians and non-physicians. Interestingly, loss to follow-up (LTFU) (N=53,435) was reduced for non-physicians with a hazard ratio of 0.72 (CI: 0.56-0.94). TB diagnosis rates, adherence and weight gain were similar for non-physicians and physicians. Patient satisfaction appeared higher for non-physicians in qualitative components of studies and was attributed to non-physicians spending more time with patients as well as providing more holistic care. CONCLUSIONS: Non-physician-provided HIV care results in equivalent outcomes to care provided by physicians and may result in decreased LTFU rates.</td>

      <td>Critiques of biomedical research in low-resource settings typically centre on clinical trials and the 'dissymmetries of power' between the researched and those benefiting from the products of research. It is important to extend this critical lens to other forms of global health research. We conducted a qualitative study in Tanzania to explore meaning and experiences of participating in a clinical observational study evaluating the safety and efficacy of current practice for treating HIV and malaria co-infection. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were undertaken with 124 study participants, study staff and health workers. Participants' understanding of the study's research aims was limited, but the practice of participation - engaging with research staff and materials - appeared to facilitate interpretations of the study's value, conceptualised as a 'service'. For those peripheral to the study, however, interpretations of it reflected existing suspicions of experimental research. Our findings indicate the importance of considering the expectations, roles and responsibilities constructed through the practice of participation in different types of research, and how they relate to legacies of research. Understanding how networks of research practice intersect local social and historical contexts can extend discussions of collaboration and engagement with research in low-resource settings.</td>

      <td>Changes in the burden of malaria following scale up of malaria control interventions in Mutasa District, Zimbabwe.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: To better understand trends in the burden of malaria and their temporal relationship to control activities, a survey was conducted to assess reported cases of malaria and malaria control activities in Mutasa District, Zimbabwe. METHODS: Data on reported malaria cases were abstracted from available records at all three district hospitals, three rural hospitals and 25 rural health clinics in Mutasa District from 2003 to 2011. RESULTS: Malaria control interventions were scaled up through the support of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and The President's Malaria Initiative. The recommended first-line treatment regimen changed from chloroquine or a combination of chloroquine plus sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine to artemisinin-based combination therapy, the latter adopted by 70%, 95% and 100% of health clinics by 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Diagnostic capacity improved, with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) available in all health clinics by 2008. Vector control consisted of indoor residual spraying and distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets. The number of reported malaria cases initially increased from levels in 2003 to a peak in 2008 but then declined 39% from 2008 to 2010. The proportion of suspected cases of malaria in older children and adults remained high, ranging from 75% to 80%. From 2008 to 2010, the number of RDT positive cases of malaria decreased 35% but the decrease was greater for children younger than five years of age (60%) compared to older children and adults (26%). CONCLUSIONS: The burden of malaria in Mutasa District decreased following the scale up of malaria control interventions. However, the persistent high number of cases in older children and adults highlights the need for strategies to identify locally effective control measures that target all age groups.</td>

      <td>The development of resistance mutations in drug-targeted HIV-1 genes compromises the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs. Genotyping of these mutations enables adjusted therapeutic decisions both at the individual and population level. We investigated over time the prevalence of HIV-1 primary drug resistance mutations in treatment-naive patients and described the HIV-1 subtype distribution in a cohort in rural Tanzania at the beginning of the ART rollout in 2005-2007 and later in 2009. Viral RNA was analyzed in 387 baseline plasma samples from treatment-naive patients over a period of 5 years. The reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes were reversely transcribed, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified, and directly sequenced to identify HIV-1 subtypes and single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with drug resistance (DR-SNPs). The prevalence of major DR-SNPs in 2005-2007 in the RT gene was determined: K103N (5.0%), Y181C (2.5%), M184V (2.5%), and G190A (1.7%), and M41L, K65KR, K70KR, and L74LV (0.8%). In samples from 2009 only K103N (3.3%), M184V, and T215FY (0.8%) were detected. Initial frequencies of subtypes C, A, D, and recombinants were 43%, 32%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. Later similar frequencies were found except for the recombinants, which were found twice as often (15%), highlighting the subtype diversity and a relatively stable subtype frequency in the area. DR-SNPs were found at initiation of the cohort despite very low previous ART use in the area. Statistically, frequencies of major mutations did not change significantly over the studied 5-year interval. These mutations could reflect primary resistances and may indicate a possible risk for treatment failure.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: HIV-infected children have less access to combination antiretroviral therapy as compared with adults in resource-limited settings. Growth faltering, loss to follow-up (LTFU) and high mortality are frequently seen. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed with parameters extracted from the Drug Resource Enhancement against AIDS and Malnutrition database for HIV-infected, antiretroviral naive children under 15 years presenting for care at 17 Drug Resource Enhancement against AIDS and Malnutrition centers in Mozambique, Malawi and Guinea between January 2005 to December 2008. Predictors of time-to-death, time-to-LTFU and persistence of malnutrition by Cox's regression and Kaplan-Meier were determined. RESULTS: 2215 children presented to care with 1343 (61%) being </= 5 years. At baseline, stunting and malnutrition occurred in 40% and 25%, respectively; 75% of 2149 children had CD4 cell percentages less than 20; median HIV RNA, log10 cp/mL, was 4.97 in 1927 patients. Over time 238 children died (10.7%; 2.7% person-years [PY]) 63 were LTFU (2.8%; 0.7% PY). By multivariate analysis, mortality was associated with virus load (hazards ratio: 1.19; confidence interval: 1.01-1.402, P = 0.038) and reduced weight-for-age Z scores (hazards ratio: 0.590; confidence interval: 0.53-0.66, P < 0.001). LTFU was associated with low weight-for-height Z scores (hazards ratio: 0.71; confidence interval: 0.51-0.97, P = 0.031). At 12 months after combination antiretroviral therapy, anthropometric parameters significantly improved in 1226 children (P < 0.001); virus load declined to <400 copies/mL in over 60%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite advanced HIV disease, children initiating combination antiretroviral therapy had mortality rates of 2.7% p/PY with overall attrition rates of 11.7% p/100 PY, with significant reversal of negative anthropometric markers, and improvement of immunological and virological parameters in children with 12 months of follow-up.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, most HIV-infected patients receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) without virological monitoring. Longitudinal data on secondary resistance are rare. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of HIV-1-infected adults initiating ART in 3 clinics using computerized monitoring systems. Patients had plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL) tests at months 12 (M12) and 24 (M24) after ART initiation and HIV-1 resistance genotype tests if VL was detectable (>/=300 copies/mL). RESULTS: Overall, 1573 patients initiated ART with stavudine/zidovudine plus lamivudine plus nevirapine/efavirenz. At M12 and M24, 944 and 844 patients, respectively, remained in active follow-up. Among them, 25% (M12) and 27% (M24) had detectable VLs and 12% (M12) and 19% (M24) had virus resistant to at least 1 antiretroviral drug, accounting for 54% (M12) and 75% (M24) of patients with detectable VLs. Among the resistant strains, 95% (M12) and 97% (M24) were resistant to lamivudine/emtricitabine, efavirenz, and/or nevirapine, the frequency of thymidine analog mutations increased from 8.1% (M12) to 14.7% (M24) and etravirine resistance increased from 13.5% (M12) to 24.5% (M24). CONCLUSIONS: Of the patients with detectable VLs at M24, 25% still did not harbor resistant virus. Preventing mutations from emerging with adherence reinforcement in patients with detectable VLs remains important beyond M24. Switching therapy early in patients with resistance to 3 TC/FTC and/or to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors to prevent extended resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and etravirine resistance from occurring is also a major challenge.</td>

      <td>Patient retention is critical to the management of chronic diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); hence, accurate measures of loss to follow-up (LTF) are important. Many different LTF definitions have been proposed. In a cohort of 9,692 HIV-infected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy in Mozambique from 2006 to 2011, we investigated the impact of the definition of LTF on estimated rates of LTF, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining events, and death by applying 17 different definitions of LTF gleaned from HIV literature. We further investigated the impact of 4 specific components of the LTF definitions. Cumulative incidences of LTF and AIDS-defining events were estimated by treating death as a competing risk; Kaplan-Meier techniques and variations to account for informative censoring were used to estimate rates of mortality. Estimates of LTF 2 years after treatment initiation were high and varied substantially, from 22% to 84% depending on the LTF definition used. Estimates of 2-year mortality varied from 11% to 16%, and estimates of 2-year AIDS-defining events varied from 6% to 8%. As seen here, the choice of LTF definition can greatly affect study conclusions and program evaluations. Selection of LTF definitions should be based on the study outcome, available data on clinical encounters, and the patients' visit schedules; we suggest some general guidelines.</td>

      <td>Preventing nosocomial MDR TB transmission in sub Saharan Africa: where are we at?</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In sub Saharan Africa, the cocktail of many advanced HIV-infected susceptible hosts, poor TB treatment success rates, a lack of airborne infection control, limited drug-resistance testing (DST) have resulted in HIV-infected individuals being disproportionately represented in Multi drug resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases. The prevailing application of the WHO re-treatment protocol indiscriminately to all re-treatment cases sets the stage for an increase in mortality and MDR-TB nosocomial transmission. METHOD: A comprehensive search was performed of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register and Medline database including the bibliographies of the retrieved reference. FINDINGS: The TB diagnosis paradigm which for decades relied on smear sputum and culture is likely to change with the advent of the point-of-care diagnostic, Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Until the new DST infrastructure is available, along with clinical trials for both, current and new approaches to retreatment TB in areas heavily affected by HIV and TB, there are cost effective administrative, environmental, and protective measures that may be immediately instituted. CONCLUSION: The severe lack of infection control practices in sub Saharan Africa may jeopardise the recent strides in MDR-TB management. Cost effective infection control measures must be immediately implemented, otherwise the development of further drug resistance may offset recent strides in MDR-TB management. Indiscriminate use of the WHO standardized retreatment protocol can lead to nosocomial transmission of MDR-TB by: -Precluding early diagnosis and prompt separation of patients who experienced treatment failure category and thereby more likely to have MDR-TB. -Leaving patients from the treatment failure category in health establishments on ineffective standard retreatment regimen until the DST results are known. -targeting only patients who have had prior TB therapy, new severely debilitated TB patients having primary unrecognized MDR-TB may continue spreading resistant organisms.</td>

      <td>Adherence to antiretroviral therapy among HIV infected children measured by caretaker report, medication return, and drug level in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Adherence to antiretroviral drugs in the treatment of paediatric HIV infection is complicated because of many factors including stigma and drug intake logistics. It is therefore important to identify children with non-adherence in order to intervene before they become at risk of developing treatment failure or drug resistance. The aim of this study was to determine the level of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), measured by caretaker report, medication return and nevirapine plasma concentration. In addition, the association between level of adherence and patient's immune status was compared across the three methods of measuring adherence. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study involving HIV infected children aged 2-14 years, on nevirapine- based antiretroviral treatment for at least six months, attending care and treatment clinic in three municipal hospitals in Dar- Es- Salaam City. Eligible patients and their accompanying caretakers were consecutively enrolled after obtaining written informed consent. Structured questionnaires were administered to caretakers to assess patient's adherence by caretaker report and medication return whereas a single blood sample for CD4 cell count/percent and determination of nevirapine plasma concentration was taken from patients on the day of assessment. RESULTS: A total of 300 patients and accompanying caretakers were enrolled and the mean patient age (SD) was 8 (3) years. Caretakers' report and medication return showed good adherence (98% and 97%) respectively. However, the level of adherence assessed by nevirapine plasma concentration (85%) was significantly lower than caretaker report and medication return (p < 0.001). The agreement between nevirapine plasma concentration and medication return and between nevirapine plasma concentration and caretaker report was weak (k = 0. 131) (k = 0. 09) respectively. Nevirapine plasma concentration below 3 mug/ml was associated with immunosuppression (p = 0. 021) whereas medication return (>5% of prescribed doses) and caretaker reported missing more than one dose within 72 hours prior to interview were not associated with immunosuppression (p = 0. 474), (p = 0. 569) respectively. CONCLUSION: Lower adherence level observed using nevirapine plasma concentration and its association with immunological response supports the validity of the method and indicates that adherence data obtained from caretaker report and medication return may overestimate the true adherence in paediatric antiretroviral therapy.</td>

      <td>HIV drug resistance early warning indicators in Namibia for public health action.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) testing is not routinely available in many resource-limited settings, therefore antiretroviral therapy (ART) program and site factors known to be associated with emergence of HIVDR should be monitored to optimize the quality of patient care and minimize the emergence of preventable HIVDR. METHODS: In 2010, Namibia selected five World Health Organization Early Warning Indicators (EWIs) and scaled-up monitoring from 9 to 33 ART sites: ART prescribing practices, Patients lost to follow-up (LTFU) at 12 months, Patients switched to a second-line regimen at 12 months, On-time antiretroviral (ARV) drug pick-up, and ARV drug-supply continuity. RESULTS: Records allowed reporting on three of the five selected EWIs. 22 of 33 (67%) sites met the target of 100% initiated on appropriate first-line regimens. 17 of 33 (52%) sites met the target of </=20% LTFU. 15 of 33 (45%) sites met the target of 0% switched to a second-line regimen. CONCLUSIONS: EWI monitoring directly resulted in public health action which will optimize the quality of care, specifically the strengthening of ART record systems, engagement of ART sites, and operational research for improved adherence assessment and ART patient defaulter tracing.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of expanded eligibility criteria for antiretroviral therapy (ART) on median CD4(+) cell count at ART initiation and early mortality on ART. METHODS: Analyses included all adults (>/=16 years) initiated on first-line ART between August 2004 and July 2012. CD4(+) cell count threshold 350 cells per microliter for all adults was implemented in August 2011. Early mortality was defined as any death within 91 days of ART initiation. Trends in baseline CD4(+) cell count and early mortality were examined by year (August to July) of ART initiation. Competing risks analysis was used to examine early mortality. RESULTS: A total of 19,080 adults (67.6% female) initiated ART. Median CD4(+) cell count at ART initiation was 110-120 cells per microliter over the first 6 years, increasing marginally to 145 cells per microliter in 2010-2011 and more significantly to 199 cells per microliter in 2011-2012. Overall, there were 875 deaths within 91 days of ART initiation; early mortality rate was 19.4 per 100 person-years [95% confidence interval (CI) 18.2 to 20.7]. After adjustment for sex, age, baseline CD4(+) cell count, and concurrent tuberculosis (TB), there was a 46% decrease in early mortality for those who initiated ART in 2011-2012 compared with the reference period 2008-2009 (subhazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.71). CONCLUSIONS: Since the expansion of eligibility criteria, there is evidence of earlier access to ART and a significant reduction in early mortality rate in this primary health care programme. These findings provide strong support for national ART policies and highlight the importance of earlier ART initiation for achieving reductions in HIV-related mortality.</td>

      <td>Resistance to tenofovir-based regimens during treatment failure of subtype C HIV-1 in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is increasingly available for patients infected with subtype C HIV-1. This subtype is reported to develop the principal TDF resistance mutation in the HIV reverse transcriptase, K65R, with greater propensity than other subtypes. We sought to describe K65R development during TDF use in a cohort of patients infected with subtype C HIV. METHODS: Using a prospectively followed cohort with 6 monthly HIV RNA assays, we identified virological failure (defined as an HIV RNA > 1,000 copies/ml) during treatment that included TDF. Residual serum, stored at the time of the HIV RNA assay, was used for consensus sequencing and allele-specific PCR. We assessed prevalence of resistance at failure during TDF-containing treatment and associated factors. RESULTS: Among 1,682 patients on a TDF-containing regimen, 270 developed failure of which 40 were assessed for resistance. By sequencing, the K65R was identified in 5 (12%), major non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations in 24 (57%) and the M184V/I in 12 (28%) patients. The K65R was associated with lower HIV RNA at failure (HIV RNA 3.3 versus 4.2 log10 copies/ml) and prior stavudine exposure. An additional five patients had minority K65R populations identified by allele-specific PCR. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the K65R prevalence at virological failure is moderately higher in our subtype C population than some non-subtype C HIV cohorts. However, we did not find that the K65R was highly selected in HIV-1 subtype-C-infected patients with up to 6 months of failure of a TDF-containing regimen.</td>

      <td>Molecular epidemiology, drug susceptibility and economic aspects of tuberculosis in Mubende district, Uganda.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global public health problem whose effects have major impact in developing countries like Uganda. This study aimed at investigating genotypic characteristics and drug resistance profiles of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from suspected TB patients. Furthermore, risk factors and economic burdens that could affect the current control strategies were studied. METHODS: TB suspected patients were examined in a cross-sectional study at the Mubende regional referral hospital between February and July 2011. A questionnaire was administered to each patient to obtain information associated with TB prevalence. Isolates of M. tuberculosis recovered during sampling were examined for drug resistance to first line anti-TB drugs using the BACTEC-MGIT960(TM) system. All isolates were further characterized using deletion analysis, spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR analysis. Data were analyzed using different software; MIRU-VNTR plus, SITVITWEB, BioNumerics and multivariable regression models. RESULTS: M. tuberculosis was isolated from 74 out of 344 patients, 48 of these were co-infected with HIV. Results from the questionnaire showed that previously treated TB, co-infection with HIV, cigarette smoking, and overcrowding were risk factors associated with TB, while high medical related transport bills were identified as an economic burden. Out of the 67 isolates that gave interpretable results, 23 different spoligopatterns were detected, nine of which were novel patterns. T2 with the sub types Uganda-I and Uganda-II was the most predominant lineage detected. Antibiotic resistance was detected in 19% and multidrug resistance was detected in 3% of the isolates. CONCLUSION: The study detected M. tuberculosis from 21% of examined TB patients, 62% of whom were also HIV positive. There is a heterogeneous pool of genotypes that circulate in this area, with the T2 lineage being the most predominant. High medical related transport bills and drug resistance could undermine the usefulness of the current TB strategic interventions.</td>

      <td>Cryptococcal meningitis: improving access to essential antifungal medicines in resource-poor countries.</td>
      <td>Cryptococcal meningitis is the leading cause of adult meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa, and contributes up to 20% of AIDS-related mortality in low-income and middle-income countries every year. Antifungal treatment for cryptococcal meningitis relies on three old, off-patent antifungal drugs: amphotericin B deoxycholate, flucytosine, and fluconazole. Widely accepted treatment guidelines recommend amphotericin B and flucytosine as first-line induction treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. However, flucytosine is unavailable in Africa and most of Asia, and safe amphotericin B administration requires patient hospitalisation and careful laboratory monitoring to identify and treat common side-effects. Therefore, fluconazole monotherapy is widely used in low-income and middle-income countries for induction therapy, but treatment is associated with significantly increased rates of mortality. We review the antifungal drugs used to treat cryptococcal meningitis with respect to clinical effectiveness and access issues specific to low-income and middle-income countries. Each drug poses unique access challenges: amphotericin B through cost, toxic effects, and insufficiently coordinated distribution; flucytosine through cost and scarcity of registration; and fluconazole through challenges in maintenance of local stocks--eg, sustainability of donations or insufficient generic supplies. We advocate ten steps that need to be taken to improve access to safe and effective antifungal therapy for cryptococcal meningitis.</td>

      <td>Disengagement from care in a decentralised primary health care antiretroviral treatment programme: cohort study in rural South Africa.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To determine rates of, and factors associated with, disengagement from care in a decentralised antiretroviral programme. METHODS: Adults (>/=16 years) who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the Hlabisa HIV Treatment and Care Programme August 2004-March 2011 were included. Disengagement from care was defined as no clinic visit for 180 days, after adjustment for mortality. Cumulative incidence functions for disengagement from care, stratified by year of ART initiation, were obtained; competing-risks regression was used to explore factors associated with disengagement from care. RESULTS: A total of 4,674 individuals (median age 34 years, 29% male) contributed 13 610 person-years of follow-up. After adjustment for mortality, incidence of disengagement from care was 3.4 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.1-3.8). Estimated retention at 5 years was 61%. The risk of disengagement from care increased with each calendar year of ART initiation (P for trend <0.001). There was a strong association between disengagement from care and higher baseline CD4+ cell count (subhazard ratio (SHR) 1.94 (P < 0.001) and 2.35 (P < 0.001) for CD4+ cell count 150-200 cells/mul and >200 cells/mul respectively, compared with CD4 count <50 cells/mul). Of those disengaged from care with known outcomes, the majority (206/303, 68.0%) remained resident within the local community. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing disengagement from care threatens to limit the population impact of expanded antiretroviral coverage. The influence of both individual and programmatic factors suggests that alternative service delivery strategies will be required to achieve high rates of long-term retention.</td>

      <td>Treatment failure and drug resistance is more frequent in HIV-1 subtype D versus subtype A-infected Ugandans over a 10-year study period.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of HIV-1 subtype on treatment outcomes and the emergence of drug resistance in the resource limited setting of Kampala, Uganda. DESIGN: The Joint Clinical Research Centre (JCRC) in Kampala, Uganda has provided over 2000 drug-resistant genotypes (DRGs) over the past 10 years as standard of care for patients failing therapy and 1403 from treatment-naive and experienced patients over the past 10 years have been analyzed for this study. METHOD: Viral loads, CD4 cell count, treatment histories and other relevant clinical data was compared with the infecting HIV-1 subtype and DRGs of Ugandan patients failing treatment. RESULTS: Patients failing HAART with DRGs (n = 937) were more frequently infected with subtype D than expected on the basis of the subtype distribution in the treatment-naive population (n = 655) in Kampala (P < 0.001). Higher proportions of treatment failures among subtype D-infected patients were driven by resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) (P < 0.0002) more than to non-NRTIs (P > 0.04) or protease inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Higher rates of treatment failure among subtype D as compared with subtype A-infected Ugandans was analogous to the faster disease progression in subtype D-infected patients. The mechanism(s) by which drug resistance may emerge faster in subtype D HIV-1 may relate to higher replicative fitness and increased propensity for a CXCR4 tropism.</td>

      <td>Rates of switching antiretroviral drugs in a primary care service in South Africa before and after introduction of tenofovir.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Antiretroviral changes (single drug substitutions and regimen switches) limit treatment options and introduce challenges such as increased cost, monitoring and adherence difficulties. Patterns of drug substitutions and regimen switches from stavudine (d4T) and zidovudine (AZT) regimens have been well described but data on tenofovir (TDF) are more limited. This study describes the patterns and risk factors for drug changes of these antiretroviral drugs in adults. METHOD: This retrospective cohort study included HIV positive, antiretroviral treatment (ART) naive adults aged >/=18 years who started ART with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Follow-up was censored at first drug change and analysis focused on NRTI changes only. RESULTS: Between September 2002 and April 2011, 5095 adults initiated ART in Gugulethu. This comprised 948 subjects on TDF, 3438 on d4T and 709 subjects on AZT. Virological suppression rates at 1 year, regimen switching due to virological failure and overall losses to the programme were similar across the three groups. TDF had the lowest incidence rate of drug substitutions (2.6 per 100 P/Ys) compared to 17.9 for d4T and 8.5 per 100 P/Ys for AZT. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) accounted for the majority of drug substitutions of d4T. Multivariate analysis showed that increasing age, female sex and d4T exposure were associated with increased hazard of drug substitution due to ADRs. Conversely, TDF exposure was associated with a substantially lower risk of substitution (adjusted hazards ratio 0.38; 95% CI 0.20-0.72). CONCLUSION: Regimen switches and virological suppression were similar for patients exposed to TDF, d4T and AZT, suggesting all regimens were equally effective. However, TDF was better tolerated with a substantially lower rate of drug substitutions due to ADRs.</td>

      <td>Prescription patterns and drug use among pregnant women with febrile Illnesses in Uganda: a survey in out-patient clinics.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Malaria is a public health problem in Uganda; affecting mainly women and children. Effective treatment has been hampered by over-diagnosis and over-treatment with anti-malarial drugs among patients presenting with fever. In order to understand the effect of drug pressure on sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance in pregnancy, a sample of pregnant women presenting with fever in out-patient clinics was studied. The main objective was to assess prescription patterns and drug use in pregnancy especially SP; and draw implications on the efficacy of SP for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp). METHODS: A total of 998 pregnant women with a history of fever were interviewed and blood samples taken for diagnosis of malaria and HIV infections. Data were captured on the drugs prescribed for the current febrile episode and previous use of drugs especially SP, anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) and cotrimoxazole. RESULTS: Few pregnant women, 128 (12.8%) were parasitaemic for P.falciparum; and of these, 72 (56.3%) received first-line treatment with Artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem(R)) 14 (10.9%) SP and 33 (25.8%) quinine. Of the parasite negative patients (non-malarial fevers), 186 (21.4%) received Coartem, 423 (48.6%) SP and 19 (2.1%) cotrimoxazole. Overall, malaria was appropriately treated in 35.5% of cases. Almost all febrile pregnant women, 91.1%, were sleeping under a mosquito net. The majority of them, 911 (91.3%), accepted to have an HIV test done and 92 (9.2%) were HIV positive. Of the HIV positive women, 23 (25.0%) were on ARVs, 10 (10.9%) on cotrimoxazole and 30 (32.6%) on SP. A significant proportion of women, 40 (43.5%), were on both SP and cotrimoxazole. Age and occupation were associated with diagnosis and treatment of malaria and HIV infections. CONCLUSION: There is inappropriate treatment of malaria and non-malarial fevers among pregnant women in these facilities. This is due to non-adherence to the guidelines. Over-prescription and use of anti-malarial drugs, especially SP may have implications on resistance against SP for malaria prevention in pregnancy. The policy implications of these findings are to evaluate SP efficacy as IPTp; and the need to enforce adherence to the current clinical treatment guidelines.</td>

      <td>Resistance at virological failure using boosted protease inhibitors versus nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors as first-line antiretroviral therapy--implications for sustained efficacy of ART in resource-limited settings.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Increases in the prevalence of resistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have been observed among previously untreated individuals in all areas of sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to examine whether first-line use of 2 NRTIs plus a boosted protease inhibitor (bPI) could protect against emergence of NRTI resistance mutations, compared to the use of 2 NRTIs plus 1 NNRTI. METHODS: We carried out a weighted meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials comparing bPI- with NNRTI-based first-line antiretroviral therapy regimens using random effects modeling. RESULTS: In intention to treat analyses, there was no difference in the risk of viral failure at week 48 between NNRTI and bPI (P = .19). At week 48, the overall difference between NNRTI- and PI-based regimens in selection of any major NRTI resistance mutation (crude unweighted prevalence 3.3% vs 1.6%) was 1.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], .4-3.0; P = .00927). There was a statistically significant difference in prevalence of K65R when comparing NNRTI (1.3%) with PI (0.67%); absolute weighted difference 1.0% (95% CI, .3-1.7; P = .00447). There was also a significant difference in prevalence of M184V/I between NNRTI and PI (crude unweighted prevalence 3.2% vs 1.4%); difference 1.6% (95% CI 0.1-3.1; P = .0368). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the equivalent efficacy and more favorable resistance implications of PI- versus NNRTI-based first line therapy, widespread use of PI-based first-line therapy is not warranted at this time, due to resource limitations and predicted increased risk of resistance-related failure of NNRTI/NRTI second-line regimens. PI-based first-line therapy could be reconsidered when antiretroviral agents from other classes become available for second-line regimens in resource-limited settings.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: Tenofovir (TDF) is part of the WHO recommended first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART); however, there are limited data comparing TDF to other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in resource-limited-settings. Using a routine workplace and community-based ART cohort in South Africa, we assessed single drug substitution, HIV RNA suppression, CD4 count increase, loss-from-care, and mortality between TDF, stavudine (d4T) 30 mg dose, and zidovudine (AZT). METHODS: In a prospective cohort study we included ART naive patients aged >/=17 years-old who initiated ART containing TDF, d4T, or AZT between 2007 and 2009. For analysis of single drug substitutions we used a competing-risks time-to-event analysis; for loss-from-care, mixed-effect Poisson modeling; for HIV RNA suppression, competing-risks logistic regression; for CD4 count slope, mixed-effects linear regression; and for mortality, proportional hazards modeling. RESULTS: Of 6,196 patients, the initial drug was TDF for 665 (11%), d4T for 4,179 (68%), and AZT for 1,352 (22%). During the first 6 months of ART, the adjusted hazard ratio for a single drug substitution was 2.3 for d4T (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27, 19) and 5.2 for AZT (95% CI: 1.1, 23), compared to TDF; whereas, after 6 months, it was 10 (95% CI: 5.8, 18) and 4.4 (95% CI: 2.5, 7.8) for d4T and AZT, respectively. Virologic suppression was similar by agent; however, CD4 count rise was lowest for AZT. The adjusted hazard ratio for loss-from-care, when compared to TDF, was 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1, 1.9) for d4T and 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1, 1.4) for AZT. The adjusted hazard ratio for mortality, when compared to TDF, was 2.7 (95% CI: 2.0, 3.5) and 1.4 (95% CI: 1.3, 1.5) and for d4T and AZT, respectively. DISCUSSION: In routine care, TDF appeared to perform better than either d4T or AZT, most notably with less drug substitution and mortality than for either other agent.</td>

      <td>SETTING: Kibong'oto National Tuberculosis Hospital (KNTH), Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. OBJECTIVE: Characterize the diagnostic process and interim treatment outcomes from patients treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Tanzania. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was performed among all patients treated at KNTH for pulmonary MDR-TB between November 2009 and September 2011. RESULTS: Sixty-one culture-positive MDR-TB patients initiated therapy, 60 (98%) with a prior history of TB treatment. Forty-one (67%) were male and 9 (14%) were HIV infected with a mean CD4 count of 424 (+/-106) cells/microl. The median time from specimen collection to MDR-TB diagnosis and from diagnosis to initiation of MDR-TB treatment was 138 days (IQR 101-159) and 131 days (IQR 32-233), respectively. Following treatment initiation four (7%) patients died (all HIV negative), 3 (5%) defaulted, and the remaining 54 (89%) completed the intensive phase. Most adverse drug reactions were mild to moderate and did not require discontinuation of treatment. Median time to culture conversion was 2 months (IQR 1-3) and did not vary by HIV status. In 28 isolates available for additional second-line drug susceptibility testing, fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside and para-aminosalicylic acid resistance was rare yet ethionamide resistance was present in 9 (32%). CONCLUSION: The majority of MDR-TB patients from this cohort had survived a prolonged referral process, had multiple episodes of prior TB treatment, but did not have advanced AIDS and converted to culture negative early while completing an intensive inpatient regimen without serious adverse event. Further study is required to determine the clinical impact of second-line drug susceptibility testing and the feasibility of alternatives to prolonged hospitalization.</td>

      <td>Early upper digestive tract side effects of zidovudine with tenofovir plus emtricitabine in West African adults with high CD4 counts.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Tenofovir (TDF) with emtricitabine (FTC) and zidovudine (ZDV) is a recognized alternate first-line antiretroviral (ART) regimen for patients who cannot start treatment with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Clinical studies comparing TDF+FTC+ZDV to other regimens are lacking. METHODS: Participants in a trial of early ART in Cote d'Ivoire (Temprano ANRS 12136) started treatment with TDF/FTC plus either efavirenz (EFV) or ZDV (HIV-1+2 dually infected patients and women refusing contraception or previously treated with nevirapine). We compared rates of upper digestive serious adverse events (sAEs) between TDF/FTC+EFV and TDF/FTC+ZDV patients during the first six months of treatment. sAEs were defined as either grade 3-4 AEs or persistent grade 1-2 AEs leading to drug discontinuation. RESULTS: A total of 197 patients (76% women, median CD4 count 395/mm(3)) started therapy with TDF/FTC, 126 with EFV and 71 with ZDV. During the first six months of ART, 94 patients had digestive AEs (nausea/vomiting) of any grade (EFV 36/126, 29%; ZDV 58/71, 82%, p<0.0001), including 20 sAEs (EFV 3/126, 5%; ZDV 17/71, 24%, p<0.0001). In-patients on TDF/FTC+ZDV with digestive AEs, the median time to the first symptom was two days (IQR: 1-4). Plasma ZDV (Cmax) distributions and pill ZDV dosages were normal. Patients with digestive AEs had higher haemoglobin levels and tended to have higher body mass indices and more frequent past histories of cotrimoxazole (CTX) prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: We observed an unexpectedly high rate of digestive sAEs in West African adults, mostly women, who started a 3-nuc ART with TDF/FTC+ZDV in Cote d'Ivoire. These adults were participating in a trial of early ART and had much higher CD4 counts than those who currently routinely start ART in sub-Saharan Africa. They all received CTX concomitantly with ZDV. We suggest that further early prescriptions of TDF+XTC+ZDV should be carefully monitored and that whenever possible, the rate of early upper digestive adverse events should be compared to that occurring in-patients taking other drug regimens.

      <td>Association between efavirenz-based compared with nevirapine-based antiretroviral regimens and virological failure in HIV-infected children.</td>
      <td>IMPORTANCE: Worldwide, the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) efavirenz and nevirapine are commonly used in first-line antiretroviral regimens in both adults and children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Data on the comparative effectiveness of these medications in children are limited. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether virological failure is more likely among children who initiated 1 or the other NNRTI-based HIV treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of children (aged 3-16 years) who initiated efavirenz-based (n = 421) or nevirapine-based (n = 383) treatment between April 2002 and January 2011 at a large pediatric HIV care setting in Botswana. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time from initiation of therapy to virological failure. Virological failure was defined as lack of plasma HIV RNA suppression to less than 400 copies/mL by 6 months or confirmed HIV RNA of 400 copies/mL or greater after suppression. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis compared time to virological failure by regimen. Multivariable Cox regression controlled for age, sex, baseline immunologic category, baseline clinical category, baseline viral load, nutritional status, NRTIs used, receipt of single-dose nevirapine, and treatment for tuberculosis. RESULTS: With a median follow-up time of 69 months (range, 6-112 months; interquartile range, 23-87 months), 57 children (13.5%; 95% CI, 10.4%-17.2%) initiating treatment with efavirenz and 101 children (26.4%; 95% CI, 22.0%-31.1%) initiating treatment with nevirapine had virological failure. There were 11 children (2.6%; 95% CI, 1.3%-4.6%) receiving efavirenz and 20 children (5.2%; 95% CI, 3.2%-7.9%) receiving nevirapine who never achieved virological suppression. The Cox proportional hazard ratio for the combined virological failure end point was 2.0 (95% CI, 1.4-2.7; log rank P < .001, favoring efavirenz). None of the measured covariates affected the estimated hazard ratio in the multivariable analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among children aged 3 to 16 years infected with HIV and treated at a clinic in Botswana, the use of efavirenz compared with nevirapine as initial antiretroviral treatment was associated with less virological failure. These findings may warrant additional research evaluating the use of efavirenz and nevirapine for pediatric patients.</td>

      <td>Development and evaluation of an affordable real-time qualitative assay for determining HIV-1 virological failure in plasma and dried blood spots.</td>
      <td>Virological failure (VF) has been identified as the earliest, most predictive determinant of HIV-1 antiretroviral treatment (ART) failure. Due to the high cost and complexity of virological monitoring, VF assays are rarely performed in resource-limited settings (RLS). Rather, ART failure is determined by clinical monitoring and to a large extent immunological monitoring. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a low-cost, dried blood spot (DBS)-compatible qualitative assay to determine VF, in accordance with current WHO guideline recommendations for therapy switching in RLS. The assay described here is an internally controlled qualitative real-time PCR targeting the conserved long terminal repeat domain of HIV-1. This assay was applied to HIV-1 subtypes A to H and further evaluated on HIV-1 clinical plasma samples from South Africa (n = 191) and Tanzania (n = 42). Field evaluation was performed in Uganda using local clinical plasma samples (n = 176). Furthermore, assay performance was evaluated for DBS. This assay is able to identify VF for all major HIV-1 group M subtypes with equal specificity and has a lower detection limit of 1.00E+03 copies/ml for plasma samples and 5.00E+03 copies/ml for DBS. Comparative testing yielded accurate VF determination for therapy switching in 89% to 96% of samples compared to gold standards. The assay is robust and flexible, allowing for "open platform" applications and producing results comparable to those of commercial assays. Assay design enables application in laboratories that can accommodate real-time PCR equipment, allowing decentralization of testing to some extent. Compatibility with DBS extends access of sampling and thus access to this test to remote settings.</td>

      <td>Prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance among women screening for HIV prevention trials in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (MTN-009).</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: A major concern with using antiretroviral (ARV)-based products for HIV prevention is the potential spread of drug resistance, particularly from individuals who are HIV-infected but unaware of their status. Limited data exist on the prevalence of HIV infection or drug resistance among potential users of ARV-based prevention products. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of reproductive-aged women who presented to screen for an HIV prevention trial was conducted at 7 clinical sites in Durban, South Africa. CD4+T cell counts, HIV-1 RNA levels and population sequencing of the protease and reverse transcriptase genes were performed for all women with 2 positive HIV rapid tests. Resistance mutations were identified using the Stanford Calibrated Population Resistance Tool. RESULTS: Of the 1073 evaluable women, 400(37%) were confirmed as HIV-infected. Of those, plasma HIV-1 RNA was detectable in 365/400(91%) and undetectable(<40 copies/ml) in 35/400(9%) women. 156 women(39%) were eligible for antiretroviral therapy (CD4+T cell counts<350 cells/mm(3)) and 50(13%) met criteria for AIDS(CD4<200 cells/mm(3)). Of 352 plasma samples(>200 copies/ml) analyzed for drug resistance, 26(7.4%) had nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or protease inhibitor (PI) drug resistance mutations. Among those with resistance, 18/26 participants(62%) had single-class NNRTI resistance and 5/26(19%) had dual-class NRTI/NNRTI. Major mutations in reverse transcriptase included K65R(n = 1), L74I(n = 1), K103N(n = 19), V106M(n = 4), Y181C(n = 2), M184V(n = 4), and K219E/R(n = 2). Major PI-resistance mutations were rare: M46L(n = 1) and I85V(n = 1). All participants were infected with subtype C virus, except one infected with subtype A. CONCLUSIONS: In women from Durban, South Africa screening for an HIV prevention trial, the HIV prevalence was high (37%) and HIV drug resistance prevalence was above 5%. This study highlights the potential challenges faced when implementing an ARV-based prevention product that overlaps with first-line antiretroviral therapy. Effective screening to exclude HIV infection among women interested in uptake of ARV-based HIV prevention will be essential in limiting the spread of ARV resistance.</td>

      <td>Serious treatment related adverse drug reactions amongst anti-retroviral naive MDR-TB patients.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Globally treatment outcomes for multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) remain poor and this is compounded by high drug toxicity. Little is known about the influence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) on treatment outcomes in South Africa. METHODS: We evaluated the impact of severe ADRs among a prospective cohort of MDR-TB patients in South Africa (2000-2004). The HIV-infected study participants were anti-retroviral naive. RESULTS: Of 2,079 patients enrolled, 1,390 (66.8%) were included in this analysis based on known HIV test results (39.1% HIV-infected). At least one severe ADR was reported in 83 (6.9%) patients with ototoxicity being the most frequent ADR experienced (38.9%). CONCLUSIONS: We found that being HIV-infected but antiretroviral naive did not increase occurrence of SADRs in patients on second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. Early screening and proactive management of ADRs in this patient population is essential, especially given the rollout of decentralized care and the potential for overlapping toxicity of concomitant MDR-TB and HIV treatment.</td>

      <td>Short communication: high natural polymorphism in the gag gene cleavage sites of non-B HIV type 1 isolates from Gabon.</td>
      <td>The main goal of the present study was to determine the frequency of substitutions in the cleavage sites (CS) of gag gene among non-B HIV-1 isolates from Gabon. Fifty plasma specimens, collected in 2010-2011, from HIV-1-infected patients failing first-line antiretroviral (ARV) regimens (constituted of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors+one nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) (n=38) and from HIV-1-infected individuals untreated with ARV (n=12) were analyzed in the gag and gag-pol cleavage sites. Compared to HXB2 reference sequence, the total median number of substitutions in gag and gag-pol CS was 10 (range, 5-18). The cleavage site p2/NC was the most variable of the four gag CS with 100% (50/50) isolates carrying at least 1 substitution (range, 1-9). The two gag-pol TFP/p6pol and p6pol/PR CS sites were also highly variable (at least one substitution, 50/50, 100% in both cases). Substitutions at position G381 (p2/NC), L449 (p1/p6gag), and K444 (TFP/p6pol) were significantly more frequent in CRF02_AG strains, compared to other non-B strains (30.4% vs. 3.7%, p=0.03; 87.0% vs. 59.3%, p=0.03; and 91.3% vs. 59.3%, p=0.01, respectively). Other non-B subtypes were significantly more likely to harbor substitutions at position N487 (p6pol) (70.4%) than CRF02_AG (39.1%) (p=0.02). In Gabon, gag and gag-pol cleavage sites were highly polymorphic in protease inhibitor-naive patients harboring non-B HIV-1 strains. In sub-Saharan Africa, further studies are definitively required to better understand the impact of gag mutations among subjects receiving second-line LPV/r-containing regimens (monotherapy or triple combinations).</td>

      <td>A pragmatic approach to HIV-1 drug resistance determination in resource-limited settings by use of a novel genotyping assay targeting the reverse transcriptase-encoding region only.</td>
      <td>In resource-limited settings (RLS), reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors form the backbone of first-line treatment regimens. We have developed a simplified HIV-1 drug resistance genotyping assay targeting the region of RT harboring all major RT inhibitor resistance mutation positions, thus providing all relevant susceptibility data for first-line failures, coupled with minimal cost and labor. The assay comprises a one-step RT-PCR amplification reaction, followed by sequencing using one forward and one reverse primer, generating double-stranded coverage of RT amino acids (aa) 41 to 238. The assay was optimized for all major HIV-1 group M subtypes in plasma and dried blood spot (DBS) samples using a panel of reference viruses for HIV-1 subtypes A to D, F to H, and circulating recombinant form 01_AE (CRF01_AE) and applied to 212 clinical plasma samples and 25 DBS samples from HIV-1-infected individuals from Africa and Europe. The assay was subsequently transferred to Uganda and applied locally on clinical plasma samples. All major HIV-1 subtypes could be detected with an analytical sensitivity of 5.00E+3 RNA copies/ml for plasma and DBS. Application of the assay on 212 clinical samples from African subjects comprising subtypes A to D, F to H (rare), CRF01_AE, and CRF02_AG at a viral load (VL) range of 6.71E+2 to 1.00E+7 (median, 1.48E+5) RNA copies/ml was 94.8% (n = 201) successful. Application on clinical samples in Uganda demonstrated a comparable success rate. Genotyping of clinical DBS samples, all subtype C with a VL range of 1.02E+3 to 4.49E+5 (median, 1.42E+4) RNA copies/ml, was 84.0% successful. The described assay greatly reduces hands-on time and the costs required for genotyping and is ideal for use in RLS, as demonstrated in a reference laboratory in Uganda and its successful application on DBS samples.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVES: In this study we examine whether adolescents treated for HIV/AIDS in southern Africa can achieve similar treatment outcomes to adults. DESIGN: We have used a retrospective cohort study design to compare outcomes for adolescents and adults commencing antiretroviral therapy (ART) between 2004 and 2010 in a public sector hospital clinic in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. METHODS: Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to investigate risk factors for death and loss to follow-up (LTFU) (defined as missing a scheduled appointment by >/=3months). RESULTS: One thousand, seven hundred and seventy-six adolescents commenced ART, 94% having had no previous history of ART. The median age at ART initiation was 13.3 years. HIV diagnosis in 97% of adolescents occurred after presentation with clinical disease and a higher proportion had advanced HIV disease at presentation compared with adults [WHO Stage 3/4 disease (79.3 versus 65.2%, P < 0.001)]. Despite this, adolescents had no worse mortality than adults, assuming 50% mortality among those LTFU (6.4 versus 7.3 per 100 person-years, P = 0.75) with rates of loss to follow-up significantly lower than in adults (4.8 versus 9.2 per 100 person-years, P < 0.001). Among those who were followed for 5 years or more, 5.8% of adolescents switched to a second-line regimen as a result of treatment failure, compared with 2.1% of adults (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: With adolescent-focused services, it is feasible to achieve good outcomes for adolescents in large-scale ART programs in sub-Saharan Africa. However, adolescents are at high risk of treatment failure, which compromises future drug options. Interventions to address poor adherence in adolescence should be prioritized.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of pregnancy on response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in sub-Saharan Africa. We examined the effect of incident pregnancy after HAART initiation on clinical response to HAART. METHODS: We evaluated a prospective clinical cohort of adult women initiating HAART in Johannesburg, South Africa between 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2011, and followed up until an event, transfer, drop-out, or administrative end of follow-up on 30 September 2011. Women over age 45 and women who were pregnant at HAART initiation were excluded from the study. Main exposure was having experienced pregnancy after HAART initiation; main outcome was death and (separately) death or new AIDS event. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence limits (CL) using marginal structural Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The study included 7,534 women, and 20,813 person-years of follow-up; 918 women had at least one recognized pregnancy during follow-up. For death alone, the weighted (adjusted) HR was 0.84 (95% CL 0.44, 1.60). Sensitivity analyses confirmed main results, and results were similar for analysis of death or new AIDS event. Incident pregnancy was associated with a substantially reduced hazard of drop-out (HR = 0.62, 95% CL 0.51, 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: Recognized incident pregnancy after HAART initiation was not associated with increases in hazard of clinical events, but was associated with a decreased hazard of drop-out. High rates of pregnancy after initiation of HAART may point to a need to better integrate family planning services into clinical care for HIV-infected women.</td>

      <td>HIV-infected children are at high risk of acquiring drug-resistant viruses, which is of particular concern in settings where antiretroviral drug options are limited. We aimed to assess resistance patterns and predict viral drug susceptibility among children with first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) failure in Uganda. A cross-sectional analysis of children switching ART regimens due to first-line failure was performed at three clinical sites in Uganda. HIV-RNA determination and genotypic resistance testing on all specimens with HIV-RNA >1,000 copies/ml were performed. Major drug resistance mutations were scored using the 2011 International Antiviral Society-USA list. The Stanford algorithm was used to predict drug susceptibility. At the time of switch, 44 genotypic resistance tests were available for 50 children. All children harbored virus with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance [95% confidence interval (CI) 92-100%] and NRTI resistance was present in 98% (95% CI 88-100%). Forty-six percent (95% CI 30-61%) of children harbored >/=2 thymidine analog mutations. M184V was identified as the only NRTI mutation in 27% (95% CI 15-43%). HIV susceptibility to NRTIs, with the exception of tenofovir, was reduced in >/=60% of children. Ugandan children experiencing first-line ART failure in our study harbored high rates of dual-class and accumulated HIV drug resistance. Methods to prevent treatment failure, including adequate pediatric formulations and alternative second-line treatment options, are urgently needed.</td>

      <td>Generation of lineage-related, mucosally transmissible subtype C R5 simian-human immunodeficiency viruses capable of AIDS development, induction of neurological disease, and coreceptor switching in rhesus macaques.</td>
      <td>Most human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmissions are initiated with CCR5 (R5)-using viruses across mucosal surfaces, with the majority in regions where HIV type 1 (HIV-1) clade C predominates. Mucosally transmissible, highly replication competent, pathogenic R5 simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) encoding biologically relevant clade C envelopes are therefore needed as challenge viruses in vaccine efficacy studies with nonhuman primates. Here we describe the generation of three lineage-related subtype C SHIVs through four successive rapid transfers in rhesus macaques of SHIVC109F.PB4, a molecular clone expressing the soluble-CD4 (sCD4)-sensitive CCR5-tropic clade C envelope of a recently infected subject in Zambia. The viruses differed in their monkey passage histories and neutralization sensitivities but remained R5 tropic. SHIVC109P3 and SHIVC109P3N were recovered from a passage-3 rapid-progressor animal during chronic infection (24 weeks postinfection [wpi]) and at end-stage disease (34 wpi), respectively, and are classified as tier 1B strains, whereas SHIVC109P4 was recovered from a passage-4 normal-progressor macaque at 22 wpi and is a tier 2 virus, more difficult to neutralize. All three viruses were transmitted efficiently via intrarectal inoculation, reaching peak viral loads of 10(7) to 10(9) RNA copies/ml plasma and establishing viremia at various set points. Notably, one of seven (GC98) and two of six (CL31, FI08) SHIVC109P3- and SHIVC109P3N-infected macaques, respectively, progressed to AIDS, with neuropathologies observed in GC98 and FI08, as well as coreceptor switching in the latter. These findings support the use of these new SHIVC109F.PB4-derived viruses to study the immunopathology of HIV-1 clade C infection and to evaluate envelope-based AIDS vaccines in nonhuman primates.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the virological, immunological and clinical efficacy of protease inhibitor (PI)-based second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in rural South Africa. METHODS: An observational cohort study was performed on 210 patients (including 39 children) who initiated PI-based second-line therapy at least 12 months prior to data collection. Biannual clinical, immunological and virological monitoring was performed. Primary endpoints were adequate virological response (plasma HIV-1 RNA<400 copies/ml), full virological suppression (plasma HIV-1 RNA<50 copies/ml) and treatment failure (virological failure (plasma HIV-1 RNA>1000 after initial virological response) or on-going viremia (plasma HIV-1 RNA never<400 copies/ml for more than six months)). Data were analyzed by an on-treatment (OT) and intention-to-treat (ITT) approach. Analyses were primarily performed on the group of patients who switched following first-line virological failure. RESULTS: Median duration of follow-up after switch to second-line treatment was 20 months [IQR 11-35]. 191 patients had switched to second-line ART due to first-line virological failure. 139/191 of them (72.8%, ITT) were in care and on treatment at the end of follow-up and 11/191 (5.8%, ITT) had died. After twelve months, an adequate virological response was seen in 92/128 patients (71.9%, OT), of which 78/128 (60.9%, OT) experienced full virological suppression. Virological response remained stable after 24 months. Virological efficacy was similar amongst adult and pediatric patients. As in first-line ART, we observed a lack of correlation between virological failure and WHO-defined immunological failure. CONCLUSIONS: Good virological outcomes following first-line failure can be achieved with PI-based, second-line antiretroviral therapy in both adult and pediatric patients in rural South Africa. Retention rates were high and virological outcomes were sustainable during the two-year follow-up period, although persisting low-level viremia occurred in a subset of patients. The observed viro-immunological dissociation emphasizes the need for virological monitoring.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVES: Mortality in patients starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) is higher in Malawi and Zambia than in South Africa. We examined whether different monitoring of ART (viral load [VL] in South Africa and CD4 count in Malawi and Zambia) could explain this mortality difference. DESIGN: Mathematical modelling study based on data from ART programmes. METHODS: We used a stochastic simulation model to study the effect of VL monitoring on mortality over 5 years. In baseline scenario A all parameters were identical between strategies except for more timely and complete detection of treatment failure with VL monitoring. Additional scenarios introduced delays in switching to second-line ART (scenario B) or higher virologic failure rates (due to worse adherence) when monitoring was based on CD4 counts only (scenario C). Results are presented as relative risks (RR) with 95% prediction intervals and percent of observed mortality difference explained. RESULTS: RRs comparing VL with CD4 cell count monitoring were 0.94 (0.74-1.03) in scenario A, 0.94 (0.77-1.02) with delayed switching (scenario B) and 0.80 (0.44-1.07) when assuming a 3-times higher rate of failure (scenario C). The observed mortality at 3 years was 10.9% in Malawi and Zambia and 8.6% in South Africa (absolute difference 2.3%). The percentage of the mortality difference explained by VL monitoring ranged from 4% (scenario A) to 32% (scenarios B and C combined, assuming a 3-times higher failure rate). Eleven percent was explained by non-HIV related mortality. CONCLUSIONS: VL monitoring reduces mortality moderately when assuming improved adherence and decreased failure rates.</td>

      <td>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that only 30% of eligible, HIV-infected individuals start antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study seeks to explore the geographic and individual factors associated with starting ART on time. This retrospective study includes 15,734 HIV-positive adults initiating ART at two HIV clinics in Lilongwe, Malawi. The outcome was starting ART within two weeks of meeting ART eligibility as defined by the Malawi ART guidelines. Euclidean distance from patient neighbourhood to their clinic was calculated using Google Earth. Logistic regression models assessed factors influencing starting ART on time. Of 15,734 adults initiating ART, 8178 were from Lighthouse (LH) and 7556 were from Martin Preuss Center (MPC). Combined, 68.7% started treatment on time. Patients who were eligible for ART based on a CD4 cell count <250 cells/mm(3) versus WHO stage were less likely to begin ART on time at both LH (odds ratio [OR] 0.16; 95% CI 0.13-0.19) and MPC (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.21-0.28). Likelihood of starting on time decreased with each kilometer further from clinic location among LH patients (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.94-0.99); distance was not significant at MPC. In conclusion, predictors differed by clinic. Distance to clinic and type of eligibility for ART significantly influence starting ART on time.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: Nonadherence to clinic appointments is associated with poor outcomes in HIV-infected adults. We describe the effect of cumulative clinic adherence (CCA) to clinic appointments on mortality and loss to follow-up (LTFU) among HIV-infected children in Kenya. METHODS: We analyzed retrospective clinical data from HIV-infected children in the United States Agency for International Development-Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare Partnership in Kenya between 2001 and 2009. We defined CCA as the proportion of days adherent to clinic visits after enrollment. We examined the effects of CCA on both death and LTFU, controlling for demographic and clinical factors at enrollment and over time. Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying coefficients were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) associated with each 10% increase in CCA on mortality and LTFU. RESULTS: Among 3255 HIV-infected children, 1668 (51.2%) were male, median enrollment age of 5.2 years (interquartile range: 3.6-7.4). Of 2393 children with CD4 within 3 months after enrollment, 1125 (47.0%) were severely immune suppressed, 567 became LTFU, and 88 died. Children with higher CCA had a higher risk of both mortality and LTFU at 3 and 6 months. Higher CCA became protective at 24 months for mortality, AHR at 24 months: 0.7 (95% confidence interval: 0.6 to 0.9), and at 12 months for LTFU, AHR at 24 months: 0.7 (95% confidence interval: 0.7 to 0.7). CONCLUSIONS: Children adherence to clinic visits during the first 6 months of HIV care was associated with a higher risk of death and LTFU, but by 24 months, children with better CCA had a reduced risk of LTFU and mortality.</td>

      <td>Cost-effectiveness of point-of-care viral load monitoring of antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited settings: mathematical modelling study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Monitoring of HIV viral load in patients on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not generally available in resource-limited settings. We examined the cost-effectiveness of qualitative point-of-care viral load tests (POC-VL) in sub-Saharan Africa. DESIGN: Mathematical model based on longitudinal data from the Gugulethu and Khayelitsha township ART programmes in Cape Town, South Africa. METHODS: Cohorts of patients on ART monitored by POC-VL, CD4 cell count or clinically were simulated. Scenario A considered the more accurate detection of treatment failure with POC-VL only, and scenario B also considered the effect on HIV transmission. Scenario C further assumed that the risk of virologic failure is halved with POC-VL due to improved adherence. We estimated the change in costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, ICERs) of POC-VL compared with CD4 and clinical monitoring. RESULTS: POC-VL tests with detection limits less than 1000 copies/ml increased costs due to unnecessary switches to second-line ART, without improving survival. Assuming POC-VL unit costs between US$5 and US$20 and detection limits between 1000 and 10,000 copies/ml, the ICER of POC-VL was US$4010-US$9230 compared with clinical and US$5960-US$25540 compared with CD4 cell count monitoring. In Scenario B, the corresponding ICERs were US$2450-US$5830 and US$2230-US$10380. In Scenario C, the ICER ranged between US$960 and US$2500 compared with clinical monitoring and between cost-saving and US$2460 compared with CD4 monitoring. CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of POC-VL for monitoring ART is improved by a higher detection limit, by taking the reduction in new HIV infections into account and assuming that failure of first-line ART is reduced due to targeted adherence counselling.</td>

      <td>Comparison of treatment outcomes of new smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients by HIV and antiretroviral status in a TB/HIV clinic, Malawi.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Smear-positive pulmonary TB is the most infectious form of TB. Previous studies on the effect of HIV and antiretroviral therapy on TB treatment outcomes among these highly infectious patients demonstrated conflicting results, reducing understanding of important issues. METHODS: All adult smear-positive pulmonary TB patients diagnosed between 2008 and 2010 in Malawi's largest public, integrated TB/HIV clinic were included in the study to assess treatment outcomes by HIV and antiretroviral therapy status using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 2,361 new smear-positive pulmonary TB patients, 86% had successful treatment outcome (were cured or completed treatment), 5% died, 6% were lost to follow-up, 1% failed treatment, and 2% transferred-out. Overall HIV prevalence was 56%. After adjusting for gender, age and TB registration year, treatment success was higher among HIV-negative than HIV-positive patients (adjusted odds ratio 1.49; 95% CI: 1.14-1.94). Of 1,275 HIV-infected pulmonary TB patients, 492 (38%) received antiretroviral therapy during the study. Pulmonary TB patients on antiretroviral therapy were more likely to have successful treatment outcomes than those not on ART (adjusted odds ratio : 1.83; 95% CI: 1.29-2.60). CONCLUSION: HIV co-infection was associated with poor TB treatment outcomes. Despite high HIV prevalence and the integrated TB/HIV setting, only a minority of patients started antiretroviral therapy. Intensified patient education and provider training on the benefits of antiretroviral therapy could increase antiretroviral therapy uptake and improve TB treatment success among these most infectious patients.</td>

      <td>The potential cost and benefits of raltegravir in simplified second-line therapy among HIV infected patients in Nigeria and South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need to improve the evidence base for provision of second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) following first-line virological failure. This is particularly the case in Sub-Saharan Africa where 70% of all people living with HIV/AIDS (PHA) reside. The aim of this study was to simulate the potential risks and benefits of treatment simplification in second-line therapy compared to the current standard of care (SOC) in a lower-middle income and an upper-middle income country in Sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model to compare outcomes associated with reducing treatment discontinuations between current SOC for second-line therapy in South Africa and Nigeria and an alternative regimen: ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) combined with raltegravir (RAL). We used published studies and collaborating sites to estimate efficacy, adverse effect and cost. Model outcomes were reported as incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2011 USD per quality adjusted life year ($/QALY) gained. RESULTS: Reducing treatment discontinuations with LPV/r+RAL resulted in an additional 0.4 discounted QALYs and increased the undiscounted life expectancy by 0.8 years per person compared to the current SOC. The average incremental cost was $6,525 per treated patient in Nigeria and $4,409 per treated patient in South Africa. The cost-effectiveness ratios were $16,302/QALY gained and $11,085/QALY gained for Nigeria and South Africa, respectively. Our results were sensitive to the probability of ART discontinuation and the unit cost for RAL. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of raltegravir and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir was projected to be cost-effective in South Africa. However, at its current price, it is unlikely to be cost-effective in Nigeria.</td>

      <td>The effect of an anti-malarial subsidy programme on the quality of service provision of artemisinin-based combination therapy in Kenya: a cluster-randomized, controlled trial.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Many patients with suspected malaria in sub-Saharan Africa seek treatment from private providers, but this sector suffers from sub-standard medicine dispensing practices. To improve the quality of care received for presumptive malaria from the highly accessed private retail sector in western Kenya, subsidized pre-packaged artemether-lumefantrine (AL) was provided to private retailers, together with a one day training for retail staff on malaria diagnosis and treatment, job aids and community engagement activities. METHODS: The intervention was assessed using a cluster-randomized, controlled design. Provider and mystery-shopper cross-sectional surveys were conducted at baseline and eight months post-intervention to assess provider practices. Data were analysed based on cluster-level summaries, comparing control and intervention arms. RESULTS: On average, 564 retail outlets were interviewed per year. At follow-up, 43% of respondents reported that at least one staff member had attended the training in the intervention arm. The intervention significantly increased the percentage of providers knowing the first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria by 24.2% points (confidence interval (CI): 14.8%, 33.6%; adjusted p=0.0001); the percentage of outlets stocking AL by 31.7% points (CI: 22.0%, 41.3%; adjusted p=0.0001); and the percentage of providers prescribing AL for presumptive malaria by 23.6% points (CI: 18.7%, 28.6%; adjusted p=0.0001). Generally outlets that received training and job aids performed better than those receiving one or none of these intervention components. CONCLUSION: Overall, subsidizing ACT and retailer training can significantly increase the percentage of outlets stocking and selling AL for the presumptive treatment of malaria, but further research is needed on strategies to improve the provision of counselling advice to retail customers.</td>

      <td>First-line antiretroviral therapy and changes in lipid levels over 3 years among HIV-infected adults in Tanzania.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: With the rapid rollout of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there has been an increasing concern about cardiovascular risks related to ART. However, data from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected populations from this region are very limited. METHODS: Among 6385 HIV-infected adults in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, we investigated the nonfasting lipid changes over 3 years following ART initiation and their associations with different first-line ART agents that are commonly used in SSA. RESULTS: In the first 6 months of ART, the prevalence of dyslipidemia decreased from 69% to 54%, with triglyceride (TG) decreasing from 127 mg/dL to 113 mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increasing from 39 mg/dL to 52 mg/dL. After 6 months, TG returned to its baseline level and increased to 139 mg/dL at 3 years; total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol continued to increase whereas HDL cholesterol leveled off. The prevalence of dyslipidemia increased to 73% after a 3-year follow-up. In multivariate analyses, patients on zidovudine-containing regimens had a greater reduction in TG levels at 6 months (-16.0 vs -6.3 mg/dL), and a lower increase at 3 years compared to patients on stavudine-containing regimens (2.1 vs 11.7 mg/dL, P < .001); patients on nevirapine-based regimens had a higher increase in HDL cholesterol levels at 3 years compared to those on efavirenz-based regimens (13.6 vs 9.5 mg/dL, P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the latest World Health Organization guidelines on the substitution of stavudine in first-line ART in resource-limited settings, and provide further evidence for selection of lipid-friendly ART for patients in SSA.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan countries, HIV testing and treatment facilities are available, especially at subsidized rates for the past few years. METHODS: A prospective and descriptive review was conducted at Yalgado Ouedraogo Teaching Hospital Internal Medicine department in Ouagadougou, using personal case report forms, between June 2009 and August 2010 in all newly diagnosed adults with positive HIV antibody. RESULTS: The study participants consisted of 191 patients at a median age of 37 years (range, 18-65 years) and sex ratio (men/women): 0.66. In all, 110 (57.6%) patients were symptomatic. Fourteen patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 177 patients, 144 had CD4 count <350 cells/mm(3) and all have been treated. At the ninth month, weight gain and immune restoration were significant (P < .01); only 79 of the 144 patients had viral load measurement, and 76 of the 79 were undetectable. Mortality rate of treated patients was 6.25%. CONCLUSION: Laboratory tests and highly active antiretroviral therapy make the management of patients easier, but a majority of them still presented late and were still lost to follow-up. Nevertheless, we have excellent treatment success.</td>

      <td>Retention in care of HIV-infected children from HIV test to start of antiretroviral therapy: systematic review.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In adults it is well documented that there are substantial losses to the programme between HIV testing and start of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The magnitude and reasons for loss to follow-up and death between HIV diagnosis and start of ART in children are not well defined. METHODS: We searched the PubMed and EMBASE databases for studies on children followed between HIV diagnosis and start of ART in low-income settings. We examined the proportion of children with a CD4 cell count/percentage after after being diagnosed with HIV infection, the number of treatment-eligible children starting ART and predictors of loss to programme. Data were extracted in duplicate. RESULTS: Eight studies from sub-Saharan Africa and two studies from Asia with a total of 10,741 children were included. Median age ranged from 2.2 to 6.5 years. Between 78.0 and 97.0% of HIV-infected children subsequently had a CD4 cell count/percentage measured, 63.2 to 90.7% of children with an eligibility assessment met the eligibility criteria for the particular setting and time and 39.5 to 99.4% of the eligible children started ART. Three studies reported an association between low CD4 count/percentage and ART initiation while no association was reported for gender. Only two studies reported on pre-ART mortality and found rates of 13 and 6 per 100 person-years. CONCLUSION: Most children who presented for HIV care met eligibility criteria for ART. There is an urgent need for strategies to improve the access to and retention to care of HIV-infected children in resource-limited settings.</td>

      <td>Nevirapine versus efavirenz for patients co-infected with HIV and tuberculosis: a randomised non-inferiority trial.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In countries with a high incidence of HIV and tuberculosis co-infection, nevirapine and efavirenz are widely used as antiretroviral therapy but both interact with antituberculosis drugs. We aimed to compare efficacy and safety of a nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy (started at full dose) with an efavirenz-based regimen in co-infected patients. METHODS: We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised, non-inferiority trial at three health centres in Maputo, Mozambique. We enrolled adults (>/=18 years) with tuberculosis and previously untreated HIV infection (CD4 cell counts <250 cells per muL) and alanine aminotransferase and total bilirubin concentrations of less than five times the upper limit of normal. 4-6 weeks after the start of tuberculosis treatment, we randomly allocated patients (1:1) with central randomisation, block sizes of two to six, and stratified by site and CD4 cell count to nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) or efavirenz (600 mg once daily), plus lamivudine and stavudine. The primary endpoint was virological suppression at 48 weeks (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL) in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug (intention-to-treat population); death and loss to follow-up were recorded as treatment failure. The non-inferiority margin for the difference of efficacy was 10%. We assessed efficacy in intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations and safety in all patients who received study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00495326. FINDINGS: Between October, 2007, and March, 2010, we enrolled 285 patients into each group. 242 (85%) patients in the nevirapine group and 233 (82%) patients in the efavirenz group completed follow-up. In the intention-to-treat population, 184 patients (64.6%, 95% CI 58.7-70.1) allocated nevirapine achieved virological suppression at week 48, as did 199 patients (69.8%, 64.1-75.1) allocated efavirenz (one-sided 95% CI of the difference of efficacy 11.7%). In the per-protocol population, 170 (70.0%, 63.8-75.7) of 243 patients allocated nevirapine achieved virological suppression at week 48, as did 194 (78.9%, 73.2-83.8) of 246 patients allocated efavirenz (one-sided 95% CI 15.4%). The median CD4 cell count at randomisation was 89 cells per muL. 15 patients substituted nevirapine with efavirenz and six patients substituted efavirenz with nevirapine. 20 patients allocated nevirapine (7%) had grade 3-4 increase of alanine aminotransferase compared with 17 patients allocated efavirenz (6%). Three patients had severe rash after receipt of nevirapine (1%) but no patients did after receipt of efavirenz. 18 patients in the nevirapine group died, as did 17 patients in the efavirenz group. INTERPRETATION: Although non-inferiority of the nevirapine-regimen was not shown, nevirapine at full dose could be a safe, acceptable alternative for patients unable to tolerate efavirenz.

      <td>Failure to initiate antiretroviral therapy, loss to follow-up and mortality among HIV-infected patients during the pre-ART period in Uganda.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Delays and failures in initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) among treatment eligible patients may compromise the effectiveness of HIV care in Africa. An accurate understanding, however, of the pace and completeness of ART initiation and mortality during the waiting period is obscured by frequent losses to follow-up. METHODS: We evaluated newly ART-eligible HIV-infected adults from 2007 to 2011 in a prototypical clinic in Mbarara, Uganda. A random sample of patients lost to follow-up was tracked in the community to determine vital status and ART initiation after leaving the original clinic. Outcomes among the tracked patients were incorporated using probability weights, and a competing risks approach was used in analyses. RESULTS: Among 2633 ART-eligible patients, 490 were lost to follow-up, of whom a random sample of 132 was tracked and 111 (84.0%) had outcomes ascertained. After incorporating the outcomes among the lost, the cumulative incidence of ART initiation at 30, 90, and 365 days after eligibility was 16.0% [95% confidence interval (CI): 14.2 to 17.7], 64.5% (95% CI: 60.9 to 68.1), and 81.7% (95% CI: 77.7 to 85.6). Death before ART was 7.7% at 1 year. Male sex, higher CD4 count, and no education were associated with delayed ART initiation. Lower CD4 level, malnourishment, and travel time to clinic were associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Using a sampling-based approach to account for losses to follow-up revealed that both the speed and the completeness of ART initiation were suboptimal in a prototypical large clinic in Uganda. Improving the kinetics of ART initiation in Africa is needed to make ART more in real-world populations.</td>

      <td>Risk of tuberculosis after antiretroviral treatment initiation: a comparison between efavirenz and nevirapine using inverse probability weighting.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: There is a high incidence of tuberculosis (TB) early after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. This historical cohort study evaluated the association of efavirenz (EFV) compared to nevirapine (NVP) with post-ART TB among patients initiated on first-line ART from 2005 to 2009 in a large, urban HIV clinic in Uganda. METHODS: Hazard ratios (HR) for developing TB were computed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models with inverse weighting of the probability of being prescribed NVP or EFV (calculated by a multivariable logistic regression model), stratifying by baseline CD4+ T-cell count. Adjustment for time-updated CD4+ T-cell count, restriction of the analysis to patients remaining in follow-up and a TB-free survival analysis were performed as sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: ART was initiated in 5,797 patients; 66% were women with a mean age of 37 years (SD 9) and a median baseline CD4+ T-cell count of 117 cells/mm3 (IQR 43-182). Overall, 60% (n = 3,484) were initiated on NVP and 40% (n = 2,313) on EFV. In the first 2 years of ART, 377 patients developed TB. The use of EFV compared to NVP was independently associated with higher TB incidence in patients with a baseline CD4+ T-cell count < 100 cells/mm3 (HR 2.05 [95% CI 1.29, 3.27]; P = 0.003), but not at higher CD4+ T-cell counts (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.39, 1.31]; P = 0.428). These estimates were robust to all sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: There was a higher incidence of TB in patients with baseline CD4+ T-cell counts < 100 cells/mm3 initiated on EFV compared to those initiated on NVP. Further research in a trial setting or a larger multisite observational cohort is needed to confirm these findings.</td>

      <td>The impact of revised PMTCT guidelines: a view from a public sector ARV clinic in Cape Town, South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In April 2010, revised Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission guidelines were implemented in South Africa, advising fast-tracked lifelong highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation at a higher CD4 count (</=350 cells per microliter). This study describes the impact of these changes on the management of pregnant women who initiated HAART at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all women who initiated HAART in pregnancy at the Tygerberg Hospital between January 2008 and December 2010. Year cohorts were compared. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty HIV-infected women were included in the study and stratified by HAART initiation year: 2008:N = 82, 2009:N = 71, 2010:N = 97. There were no differences between the groups in age or parity. Median booking CD4 count was 155 cells per microliter [interquartile range (IQR) 107-187], 157 cells per microliter (IQR 104-206) and 208 cells per microliter (IQR 138-270), respectively (P < 0.001). Median gestation at HAART initiation was 31 weeks (IQR 27-35), 30 weeks (IQR 26-34), and 25 weeks (IQR 21-31; P < 0.001). HIV transmission rates were 3/65 (4.6%), 4/57 (7.0%), and 0/90 (0.0%; P = 0.021). Women <8 weeks on HAART before delivery were more likely to transmit than women >/=8 weeks [odds ratio 9.69; 95% confidence interval 1.66 to 56.58; P = 0.017]. Ninety-four (37.6%) women were lost to follow-up, 18.4% within 28 days of delivery. CONCLUSIONS: The positive impact of the new Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission program is evident. A longer duration of HAART before delivery was associated with less transmission. However, the lost to follow-up rates remain concerning. Further research is needed to better understand the reasons for nonadherence and mechanisms to improve support for these women.</td>

      <td>Long-term health care interruptions among HIV-positive patients in Uganda.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Retaining patients in clinical care is necessary to ensure successful antiretroviral treatment (ART) outcomes. Among patients who discontinue care, some reenter care at a later stage, whereas others are or will be lost from follow-up. We examined risk factors for health care interruptions and loss to follow-up within a cohort receiving ART in Uganda. METHODS: Using a large hospital cohort providing free universal ART and HIV clinical care, we assessed characteristics and risk factors for treatment interruptions, defined as a 12-month absence from care at Mildmay, and loss to follow-up, defined as absence from care greater than 12 months without reengagement in care at Mildmay. We included patients aged 14 years and above. We assessed these outcomes over time using Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable regression. RESULTS: Of 6970 eligible patients, 784 (11.2%) had a health care interruption of at least 12 months and 217 (3.1%) were lost to follow-up. Patients experiencing health care interruptions had higher baseline CD4 T-cell counts at ART initiation, defined as >/= 250 cells per cubic millimeter [odds ratio (OR): 1.29, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.11 to 1.50], and lower levels of education (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.61). Adolescents were much more likely to be lost to follow-up (OR: 3.11, 95% CI: 2.23 to 4.34). In contrast, having a partner (OR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.31) or being sexually active at baseline (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.55) was protective of loss to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Within this cohort, long periods of unsupervised health care interruptions were common.</td>

      <td>The global response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic has improved access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and has contributed to decreased HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Patient adherence to ART is crucial to the success of HIV/AIDS treatment. However, little is known about the determinants of adherence to ART among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This qualitative study used in-depth semi-structured patient interviews, a purposive sampling strategy and thematic analysis scheme to identify barriers and facilitators of adherence to ART in the DRC. We recruited three categories of participants from the Centre Hospitalier Monkole and the NGO ACS/Amo-Congo including participants on antiretroviral (ARV) treatment (n = 19), on ARV re-treatment (n = 13) and lost to follow-up (n = 6). Among 38 participants interviewed, 24 were female and the median age was 41 years. Food insecurity as a barrier to adherence emerged as a dominant theme across the three categories of participants. Other barriers included financial constraints, forgetfulness and fear of disclosure/stigma. Religious beliefs were both a barrier and a facilitator to ART adherence. We found that food insecurity was a common and an important barrier to ART adherence among patients in the DRC. Our findings suggest that food insecurity should be appropriately addressed and incorporated into ARV treatment programs to ensure patient adherence and ultimately the long-term success of HIV treatment in the region.</td>

      <td>Pediatric HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa: emerging issues and way forward.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Sub-Saharan Africa has the largest burden of pediatric HIV in the world. Global target has been set for eradication of pediatric HIV by 2015 but there are still so many complex issues facing HIV infected and affected children in the sub-continent. OBJECTIVE: To review the current and emerging challenges facing pediatric HIV care in sub-Saharan Africa; and proffer solutions that could help in tackling these challenges. METHOD: A Medline literature search of recent publications was performed to identify articles on "pediatric HIV", "HIV and children", "HIV and infants", "HIV and adolescents" in sub-Saharan Africa. RESULT: There are a number of challenges and emerging complex issues facing children infected and affected by HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. These include late presentation, limited access to pediatric HIV services, delayed diagnosis, infant feeding choices, malnutrition, limited and complex drug regimen, disclosure, treatment failure and reproductive health concerns. A holistic cost effective preventive, diagnostic and treatment strategies are required in order to eliminate pediatric HIV in SSA. CONCLUSION: HIV infected children and their families in sub-Saharan Africa face myriad of complex medical and psychosocial issues. A holistic health promotional approach is being advocated as the required step for eradication of pediatric HIV in Africa.</td>

      <td>Diagnosing Xpert MTB/RIF negative TB: impact and cost of alternative algorithms for South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Use of Xpert MTB/RIF is being scaled up throughout South Africa for improved diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). A large proportion of HIV-infected patients with possible TB are Xpert-negative on their initial test, and the existing diagnostic algorithm calls for these patients to have sputum culture (Xpert followed by culture (X/C)). We modelled the costs and impact of an alternative diagnostic algorithm in which these cultures are replaced with a second Xpert test (Xpert followed by Xpert (X/X)). METHODS: An existing population-level decision model was used. Costs were estimated from Xpert implementation studies and public sector price and salary data. The number of patients requiring diagnosis was estimated from the literature, as were rates of TB treatment uptake and loss to follow-up. TB and HIV positivity rates were estimated from the national TB register and laboratory databases. RESULTS: At national programme scale in 2014, X/X (R969 million/year) is less expensive than X/C R1 095 million/year), potentially saving R126 million/year (US$17.4 million). However, because Xpert is less sensitive than culture, X/X diagnoses 2% fewer TB cases. This is partly offset by higher expected treatment uptake with X/X due to the faster availability of results, resulting in 1% more patients initiating treatment under X/X than X/C. The cost per TB patient initiated on treatment under X/X is R2 682, which is 12% less than under X/C (R3 046). CONCLUSIONS: Modifying the diagnostic algorithm from X/C to X/X could provide rapid results, simplify diagnostic processes, improve HIV/TB treatment outcomes, and generate cost savings.</td>

      <td>Loss to follow-up before and after delivery among women testing HIV positive during pregnancy in Johannesburg, South Africa.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: HIV-positive pregnant women are at heightened risk of becoming lost to follow-up (LTFU) from HIV care. We examined LTFU before and after delivery among pregnant women newly diagnosed with HIV. METHODS: Observational cohort study of all pregnant women >/=18 years (N = 300) testing HIV positive for the first time at their first ANC visit between January and June 2010, at a primary healthcare clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa. Women (n = 27) whose delivery date could not be determined were excluded. RESULTS: Median (IQR) gestation at HIV testing was 26 weeks (21-30). Ninety-eight per cent received AZT prophylaxis, usually started at the first ANC visit. Of 139 (51.3%) patients who were ART eligible, 66.9% (95% CI 58.8-74.3%) initiated ART prior to delivery; median (IQR) ART duration pre-delivery was 9.5 weeks (5.1-14.2). Among ART-eligible patients, 40.5% (32.3-49.0%) were cumulatively retained through 6 months on ART. Of those ART-ineligible patients at HIV testing, only 22.6% (95% CI 15.9-30.6%) completed CD4 staging and returned for a repeat CD4 test after delivery. LTFU (>/=1 month late for last scheduled visit) before delivery was 20.5% (95% CI 16.0-25.6%) and, among those still in care, 47.9% (95% CI 41.2-54.6%) within 6 months after delivery. Overall, 57.5% (95% CI 51.6-63.3%) were lost between HIV testing and 6 months post-delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the challenge of continuity of care among HIV-positive pregnant women attending antenatal services, particularly those ineligible for ART.</td>

      <td>Treatment outcomes of HIV-infected adolescents attending public-sector HIV clinics across Gauteng and Mpumalanga, South Africa.</td>
      <td>There is little evidence comparing treatment outcomes between adolescents and other age groups, particularly in resource-limited settings. A retrospective analysis of data from seven HIV clinics across urban Gauteng (n=5) and rural Mpumalanga (n=2), South Africa was conducted. The analysis compared HIV-positive antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naive young adolescents (10-14 years), older adolescents (15-19), and young adults (20-24 years) to adults (>/=25 years) initiated onto standard first-line ART between April 2004 and August 2010. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate relative risk (RR) of failure to suppress viral load (>/=400 copies/ml) or failure to achieve an adequate CD4 response at 6 or 12 months. The effect of age group on virological failure, mortality, and loss to follow-up (LTFU; >/=90 days since scheduled visit date) was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Of 42,427 patients initiating ART, 310 (0.7%) were young adolescents, 342 (0.8%) were older adolescents, and 1599 (3.8%) were young adults. Adolescents were similar to adults in terms of proportion male, baseline CD4 count, hemoglobin, and TB. Compared to adults, both older adolescents (6 months RR 1.75 95% CI 1.25-2.47) and young adults (6 months RR 1.33 95% CI 1.10-1.60 and 12 months RR 1.64 95% CI 1.23-2.19) were more likely to have an unsuppressed viral load and were more likely to fail virologically (HR 2.90 95% CI 1.74-4.86; HR 2.94 95% CI 1.63-5.31). Among those that died or were LTFU, the median time from ART initiation until death or LTFU was 4.7 months (IQR 1.5-13.2) and 10.9 months (IQR 5.0-22.7), respectively. There was no difference in risk of mortality by age category, compared to adults. Young adolescents were less likely to be LTFU at any time period after ART initiation (HR 0.43 95% CI 0.26-0.69) whereas older adolescents and young adults were more likely to be LTFU after ART initiation (HR 1.78 95% CI 1.34-2.36; HR 1.63 95% CI 1.41-1.89) compared to adults. HIV-infected adolescents and young adults between 15 and 24 years have poorer ART treatment outcomes in terms of virological response, LTFU, and virological failure than adults receiving ART. Interventions are needed to help improve outcomes and retention in care in this unique population.</td>

      <td>Predictors of loss to follow-up among children in the first and second years of antiretroviral treatment in Johannesburg, South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Ninety percent of the world's 2.1 million HIV-infected children live in sub-Saharan Africa, and 2.5% of South African children live with HIV. As HIV care and treatment programmes are scaled-up, a rise in loss to follow-up (LTFU) has been observed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the rate of LTFU in children receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) and to identify baseline characteristics associated with LTFU in the first year of treatment. We also explored the effect of patient characteristics at 12 months treatment on LTFU in the second year. METHODS: The study is an analysis of prospectively collected routine data of HIV-infected children at the Harriet Shezi Children's Clinic (HSCC) in Soweto, Johannesburg. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to investigate associations between baseline characteristics and 12-month characteristics with LTFU in the first and second year on ART, respectively. RESULTS: The cumulative probability of LTFU at 12 months was 7.3% (95% CI 7.1-8.8). In the first 12 months on ART, independent predictors of LTFU were age <1 year at initiation, recent year of ART start, mother as a primary caregiver, and being underweight (WAZ </= -2). Among children still on treatment at 1 year from ART initiation, characteristics that predicted LTFU within the second year were recent year of ART start, mother as a primary caregiver, being underweight (WAZ </= -2), and low CD4 cell percentage. CONCLUSIONS: There are similarities between the known predictors of death and the predictors of LTFU in the first and second years of ART. Knowing the vital status of children is important to determine LTFU. Although HIV-positive children cared for by their mothers appear to be at greater risk of becoming LTFU, further research is needed to explore the challenges faced by mothers and other caregivers and their impact on long-term HIV care. There is also a need to investigate the effects of differential access to ART between mothers and children and its impact on ART outcomes in children.</td>

      <td>Gender differences in mortality and CD4 count response among virally suppressed HIV-positive patients.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Treatment outcomes for antiretroviral therapy (ART) patients may vary by gender, but estimates from current evidence may be confounded by disease stage and adherence. We investigated the gender differences in treatment response among HIV-positive patients virally suppressed within 6 months of treatment initiation. METHODS: We analyzed data from 7,354 patients initiating ART between April 2004 and April 2010 at Themba Lethu Clinic, a large urban public sector treatment facility in South Africa. We estimated the relations among gender, mortality, and mean CD4 response in HIV-infected adults virally suppressed within 6 months of treatment initiation and used inverse probability of treatment weights to correct estimates for loss to follow-up. RESULTS: Male patients had a 20% greater risk of death at both 24 months and 36 months of follow-up compared to females. Older patients and those with a low hemoglobin level or low body mass index (BMI) were at increased risk of mortality throughout follow-up. Men gained fewer CD4 cells after treatment initiation than did women. The mean differences in CD4 count gains made by women and men between baseline and 12, 24, and 36 months were 28.2 cells/mm(3) (95% confidence interval [CI] 22.2-34.3), 60.8 cells/mm(3) (95% CI 71.1-50.5 cells/mm(3)), and 83.0 cells/mm(3) (95% CI 97.1-68.8 cells/mm(3)), respectively. Additionally, patients with a current detectable viral load (>400 copies/mL) and older patients had a lower mean CD4 increase at the same time points. CONCLUSIONS: In this initially virally suppressed population, women showed consistently better immune response to treatment than did men. Promoting earlier uptake of HIV treatment among men may improve their immunologic outcomes.</td>

      <td>Toward an understanding of disengagement from HIV treatment and care in sub-Saharan Africa: a qualitative study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The rollout of antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa has brought lifesaving treatment to millions of HIV-infected individuals. Treatment is lifelong, however, and to continue to benefit, patients must remain in care. Despite this, systematic investigations of retention have repeatedly documented high rates of loss to follow-up from HIV treatment programs. This paper introduces an explanation for missed clinic visits and subsequent disengagement among patients enrolled in HIV treatment and care programs in Africa. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Eight-hundred-ninety patients enrolled in HIV treatment programs in Jos, Nigeria; Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; and Mbarara, Uganda who had extended absences from care were tracked for qualitative research interviews. Two-hundred-eighty-seven were located, and 91 took part in the study. Interview data were inductively analyzed to identify reasons for missed visits and to assemble them into a broader explanation of how missed visits may develop into disengagement. Findings reveal unintentional and intentional reasons for missing, along with reluctance to return to care following an absence. Disengagement is interpreted as a process through which missed visits and ensuing reluctance to return over time erode patients' subjective sense of connectedness to care. CONCLUSIONS: Missed visits are inevitable over a lifelong course of HIV care. Efforts to prevent missed clinic visits combined with moves to minimize barriers to re-entry into care are more likely than either approach alone to keep missed visits from turning into long-term disengagement.</td>

      <td>Decentralization of pediatric HIV care and treatment in five sub-Saharan African countries.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In resource-limited settings, decentralization of HIV care and treatment is a cornerstone of universal care and rapid scale-up. We compared trends in pediatric enrollment and outcomes at primary (PHFs) vs secondary/tertiary health facilities (SHFs). METHODS: Using aggregate program data reported quarterly from 274 public facilities in Kenya, Lesotho, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Tanzania from January 2008 to March 2010, we examined trends in number of children younger than 15 years of age initiating antiretroviral treatment (ART) by facility type. We compared clinic-level lost to follow-up (LTFU) and mortality per 100 person-years (PYs) on ART during the period by facility type. RESULTS: During the 2-year period, 17,155 children enrolled in HIV care and 8475 initiated ART in 182 (66%) PHFs and 92(34%) SHFs. PHFs increased from 56 to 182, whereas SHFs increased from 72 to 92 sites. SHFs accounted for 71% of children initiating ART; however, the proportion of children initiating ART each quarter at PHFs increased from 17% (129) to 44% (463) in conjunction with an increase in PHFs during observation period. The average LTFU and mortality rates for children on ART were 9.8/100 PYs and 5.2/100 PYs, respectively, at PHFs and 20.2/100 PYs and 6.0/100 PYs, respectively, at SHFs. Adjusted models show PHFs associated with lower LTFU (adjusted rate ratio = 0.55; P = 0.022) and lower mortality (adjusted rate ratio = 0.66; P = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: The expansion of pediatric services to PHFs has resulted in increased numbers of children on ART. Early findings suggest lower rates of LTFU and mortality at PHFs. Successful scale-up will require further expansion of pediatric services within PHFs.</td>

      <td>A survey of paediatric HIV programmatic and clinical management practices in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa--the International epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA).</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: There are limited data on paediatric HIV care and treatment programmes in low-resource settings. METHODS: A standardized survey was completed by International epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS paediatric cohort sites in the regions of Asia-Pacific (AP), Central Africa (CA), East Africa (EA), Southern Africa (SA) and West Africa (WA) to understand operational resource availability and paediatric management practices. Data were collected through January 2010 using a secure, web-based software program (REDCap). RESULTS: A total of 64,552 children were under care at 63 clinics (AP, N=10; CA, N=4; EA, N=29; SA, N=10; WA, N=10). Most were in urban settings (N=41, 65%) and received funding from governments (N=51, 81%), PEPFAR (N=34, 54%), and/or the Global Fund (N=15, 24%). The majority were combined adult-paediatric clinics (N=36, 57%). Prevention of mother-to-child transmission was integrated at 35 (56%) sites; 89% (N=56) had access to DNA PCR for infant diagnosis. African (N=40/53) but not Asian sites recommended exclusive breastfeeding up until 4-6 months. Regular laboratory monitoring included CD4 (N=60, 95%), and viral load (N=24, 38%). Although 42 (67%) sites had the ability to conduct acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears, 23 (37%) sites could conduct AFB cultures and 18 (29%) sites could conduct tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing. Loss to follow-up was defined as >3 months of lost contact for 25 (40%) sites, >6 months for 27 sites (43%) and >12 months for 6 sites (10%). Telephone calls (N=52, 83%) and outreach worker home visits to trace children lost to follow-up (N=45, 71%) were common. CONCLUSIONS: In general, there was a high level of patient and laboratory monitoring within this multiregional paediatric cohort consortium that will facilitate detailed observational research studies. Practices will continue to be monitored as the WHO/UNAIDS Treatment 2.0 framework is implemented.</td>

      <td>Barriers and facilitators to linkage to ART in primary care: a qualitative study of patients and providers in Blantyre, Malawi.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Linkage from HIV testing and counselling (HTC) to initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is suboptimal in many national programmes in sub-Saharan Africa, leading to delayed initiation of ART and increased risk of death. Reasons for failure of linkage are poorly understood. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were undertaken with health providers and HIV-positive primary care patients as part of a prospective cohort study at primary health centres in Blantyre, Malawi. Patients successful and unsuccessful in linking to ART were included. RESULTS: Progression through the HIV care pathway was strongly influenced by socio-cultural norms, particularly around the perceived need to regain respect lost during a period of visibly declining health. Capacity to call upon the support of networks of families, friends and employers was a key determinant of successful progression. Over-busy clinics, non-functioning laboratories and unsuitable tools used for ART eligibility assessment (WHO clinical staging system and centralized CD4 count measurement) were important health systems determinants of drop-out. CONCLUSIONS: Key interventions that could rapidly improve linkage include guarantee of same-day, same-clinic ART eligibility assessments; utilization of the support offered by peer-groups and community health workers; and integration of HTC and ART programmes.</td>

      <td>Gender differences in HIV disease progression and treatment outcomes among HIV patients one year after starting antiretroviral treatment (ART) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: We investigated gender differences in treatment outcome during first line antiretroviral treatment (ART) in a hospital setting in Tanzania, assessing clinical, social demographic, virological and immunological factors. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study involving HIV infected patients scheduled to start ART and followed up to 1 year on ART. Structured questionnaires and patients file review were used to collect information and blood was collected for CD4 and viral load testing. Gender differences were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-square test for continuous and categorical data respectively. Survival distributions for male and female patients were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Of 234 patients recruited in this study, 70% were females. At baseline, women had significantly lower education level; lower monthly income, lower knowledge on ARV, less advanced HIV disease (33% women; 47% men started ART at WHO stage IV, p = 0.04), higher CD4 cell count (median 149 for women, 102 for men, p = 0.02) and higher BMI (p = 0.002). After 1 year of standard ART, a higher proportion of females survived although this was not significant, a significantly higher proportion of females had undetectable plasma viral load (69% women, 45% men, p = 0.003), however females ended at a comparable CD4 cell count (median CD4, 312 women; 321 men) signifying a worse CD4 cell increase (p = 0.05), even though they still had a higher BMI (p = 0.02). The unadjusted relative hazard for death for men compared to women was 1.94. After correcting for confounding factors, the Cox proportional hazards showed no significant difference in the survival rate (relative hazard 1.02). CONCLUSION: We observed women were starting treatment at a less advanced disease stage, but they had a lower socioeconomical status. After one year, both men and women had similar clinical and immunological conditions. It is not clear why women lose their immunological advantage over men despite a better virological treatment response. We recommend continuous follow up of this and more cohorts of patients to better understand the underlying causes for these differences and whether this will translate also in longer term differences.</td>

      <td>Early outcomes of darunavir- and/or raltegravir-based antiretroviral therapy in children with multidrug-resistant HIV at a pediatric center in Botswana.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Data on the use of ritonavir-boosted darunavir (DRV/r) and/or raltegravir (RAL) in resource-limited settings are rare and there is currently no published data regarding their use among African children. Botswana has recently made DRV/r and RAL available for patients failing second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 4 multidrug-resistant pediatric patients on DRV/r- and/or RAL-based regimens. Viral load, CD4 count, adherence by pill count, and World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage prior to and after switch to DRV/r- and/or RAL-based regimen were assessed. Antiretroviral therapy history, duration of virologic failure, and time to viral suppression were also noted. Genotypic resistance assays reviewed for mutations present prior to switch. RESULTS: All patients achieved viral suppression, showed improved/stable CD4 counts, and obtained or maintained WHO clinical treatment stage I, even after long-standing virologic/immunologic failure. CONCLUSIONS: Well tolerated by and effective in our patients, DRV/r and RAL provide potentially lifesaving ART options for children and adolescents in resource-limited settings failing ART due to ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) resistance.</td>

      <td>Given the recent scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa, we sought to determine how often and at what levels do drug-resistant mutant variants exist in ART-naive HIV subtype C infected individuals. Samples from 10 ART-naive Zambian individuals were subjected to ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS) to characterize the frequency of low-abundance drug resistance mutations in the pol gene. Low-abundance clinically relevant variants were detected for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) in eight of the ten subjects. Intermediate to high-level resistance was predicted for the majority of NRTIs. Mutations conferring resistance to most first-line and some second-line therapy drugs were also observed. UDPS detected a number of additional major resistant mutations suggesting that these individuals may have an increased risk of virological failure after initiating ART. Moreover, the effectiveness of first-line and even some secondline ART may be compromised in this setting.</td>

DESIGN: We included all patients initiating ART between March 2004 and November 2007. Clinical (signs and symptoms), radiological (chest radiographs) and laboratory (mycobacterial smears, culture and tissue histology) criteria were used to record the diagnosis of TB disease in the program's electronic medical record system. METHODS: We assessed the impact of TB disease on mortality, loss to follow-up (LTFU) and incident AIDS-defining events (ADEs) through Cox models and CD4 cell and weight response to ART by non-linear mixed models. RESULTS: We studied 21,242 patients initiating ART-5,186 (24%) with TB; 62% female; median age 37 years. There were proportionately more men in the active TB (46%) than in the non-TB (35%) group. Adjusting for baseline HIV-disease severity, TB patients were more likely to die (hazard ratio--HR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.18-1.47) or have incident ADEs (HR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.19-1.45). They had lower median CD4 cell counts (77 versus 109), weight (52.5 versus 55.0 kg) and higher ADE risk at baseline (CD4-adjusted odds ratio = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.31-1.85). ART adherence was similarly good in both groups. Adjusting for gender and baseline CD4 cell count, TB patients experienced virtually identical rise in CD4 counts after ART initiation as those without. However, the overall CD4 count at one year was lower among patients with TB (251 versus 269 cells/microl). CONCLUSIONS: Clinically detected TB disease is associated with greater mortality and morbidity despite salutary response to ART. Data suggest that identifying HIV patients co-infected with TB earlier in the HIV-disease trajectory may not fully address TB-related morbidity and mortality.</td>

      <td>Long-term clinical and immunologic outcomes of HIV-infected women with and without previous exposure to nevirapine.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: To determine and compare the clinical and immunologic outcomes for HIV-infected women initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART), with and without previous exposure to single-dose nevirapine in the MTCT-Plus programme - Kampala, Uganda, from 2003 to 2011. METHODS: Retrospective comparison of prospectively collected programmatic data of clinical and immunologic treatment outcomes among HIV-infected Ugandan women, with and without prior exposure to sdNVP, who received NNRTI-based ART for a median follow-up of 6 years. RESULTS: Of the 408 women in the programme, 289 (70.8%) were started on ART, of whom 205 (70.9%) had prior exposure to sdNVP. Clinical, immunologic and combined (clinical and or immunologic) treatment failure occurred in 29 (10.0%), 132 (45.7%) and 142 (49.1%) women, respectively. There was no significant difference in the distribution of time to immunologic failure for women by exposure to sdNVP (log-rank P = 0.98). In Cox proportional hazard modelling, exposure to sdNVP was not associated with immunologic failure [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61-1.30]. CD4 count >100 cells/mm(3) at initiation was associated with reduced incidence of immunologic failure in adjusted analyses (HR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.22-0.48). CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected Ugandan women initiated on an NVP-based ART regimen had similar immunologic treatment outcomes irrespective of previous NVP exposure. CD4 cell count prior to initiating HAART was a key prognostic factor for successful long-term immunologic treatment outcomes. In poor settings, regular follow-up of patients on HAART with adequate counselling to promote adherence and safe disclosure may promote low clinical failure rates.</td>

      <td>Antiretroviral therapy outcomes among adolescents and youth in rural Zimbabwe.</td>
      <td>Around 2 million adolescents and 3 million youth are estimated to be living with HIV worldwide. Antiretroviral outcomes for this group appear to be worse compared to adults. We report antiretroviral therapy outcomes from a rural setting in Zimbabwe among patients aged 10-30 years who were initiated on ART between 2005 and 2008. The cohort was stratified into four age groups: 10-15 (young adolescents) 15.1-19 years (adolescents), 19.1-24 years (young adults) and 24.1-29.9 years (older adults). Survival analysis was used to estimate rates of deaths and loss to follow-up stratified by age group. Endpoints were time from ART initiation to death or loss to follow-up. Follow-up of patients on continuous therapy was censored at date of transfer, or study end (31 December 2008). Sex-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios for different age groups. 898 patients were included in the analysis; median duration on ART was 468 days. The risk of death were highest in adults compared to young adolescents (aHR 2.25, 95%CI 1.17-4.35). Young adults and adolescents had a 2-3 times higher risk of loss to follow-up compared to young adolescents. When estimating the risk of attrition combining loss to follow-up and death, young adults had the highest risk (aHR 2.70, 95%CI 1.62-4.52). This study highlights the need for adapted adherence support and service delivery models for both adolescents and young adults.</td>

      <td>Implementation of provider-based electronic medical records and improvement of the quality of data in a large HIV program in Sub-Saharan Africa.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Starting in June 2010 the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) clinic (a large urban HIV out-patient facility) switched to provider-based Electronic Medical Records (EMR) from paper EMR entered in the database by data-entry clerks. Standardized clinics forms were eliminated but providers still fill free text clinical notes in physical patients' files. The objective of this study was to compare the rate of errors in the database before and after the introduction of the provider-based EMR. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data in the database pre and post provider-based EMR was compared with the information in the patients' files and classified as correct, incorrect, and missing. We calculated the proportion of incorrect, missing and total error for key variables (toxicities, opportunistic infections, reasons for treatment change and interruption). Proportions of total errors were compared using chi-square test. A survey of the users of the EMR was also conducted. We compared data from 2,382 visits (from 100 individuals) of a retrospective validation conducted in 2007 with 34,957 visits (from 10,920 individuals) of a prospective validation conducted in April-August 2011. The total proportion of errors decreased from 66.5% in 2007 to 2.1% in 2011 for opportunistic infections, from 51.9% to 3.5% for ART toxicity, from 82.8% to 12.5% for reasons for ART interruption and from 94.1% to 0.9% for reasons for ART switch (all P<0.0001). The survey showed that 83% of the providers agreed that provider-based EMR led to improvement of clinical care, 80% reported improved access to patients' records, and 80% appreciated the automation of providers' tasks. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of provider-based EMR improved the quality of data collected with a significant reduction in missing and incorrect information. The majority of providers and clients expressed satisfaction with the new system. We recommend the use of provider-based EMR in large HIV programs in Sub-Saharan Africa.</td>

      <td>Measuring the degree of integrated tuberculosis and HIV service delivery in Cape Town, South Africa.</td>
      <td>To address the considerable tuberculosis (TB)/HIV co-infected population in Cape Town, a number of clinics have made an effort of varying degrees to integrate TB and HIV services. This article describes the development of a theory-based survey instrument designed to quantify the extent to which services were integrated in 33 clinics and presents the results of the survey. Using principal factor analysis, eight factors were extracted and used to make comparisons across three types of clinics: co-located TB and antiretroviral therapy (ART) services, clinics with TB services only and clinics with ART only. Clinics with co-located services scored highest on measures related to integrated TB/ART service delivery compared to clinics with single services, but within group variability was high indicating that co-location of TB and ART services is a necessary but insufficient condition for integrated service delivery. In addition, we found almost all clinics with only TB services in our sample had highly integrated pre-ART services, suggesting that integration of these services across a large number of clinics is feasible and acceptable to clinic staff. TB clinics with highly integrated pre-ART services appear to be efficient sites for introducing ART given that co-infected patients are already engaged in care, and may potentially facilitate earlier access to treatment and minimize loss to follow-up.</td>

      <td>Research on implementation of interventions in tuberculosis control in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Several interventions for tuberculosis (TB) control have been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) over the past decade. These include isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) for HIV-infected individuals and household contacts of infectious TB patients, diagnostic algorithms for rule-in or rule-out of smear-negative pulmonary TB, and programmatic treatment for multidrug-resistant TB. There is no systematically collected data on the type of evidence that is publicly available to guide the scale-up of these interventions in low- and middle-income countries. We investigated the availability of published evidence on their effectiveness, delivery, and cost-effectiveness that policy makers need for scaling-up these interventions at country level. METHODS AND FINDINGS: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and several regional databases were searched for studies published from 1 January 1990 through 31 March 2012 that assessed health outcomes, delivery aspects, or cost-effectiveness for any of these interventions in low- or middle-income countries. Selected studies were evaluated for their objective(s), design, geographical and institutional setting, and generalizability. Studies reporting health outcomes were categorized as primarily addressing efficacy or effectiveness of the intervention. These criteria were used to draw landscapes of published research. We identified 59 studies on IPT in HIV infection, 14 on IPT in household contacts, 44 on rule-in diagnosis, 19 on rule-out diagnosis, and 72 on second-line treatment. Comparative effectiveness studies were relatively few (n = 9) and limited to South America and sub-Saharan Africa for IPT in HIV-infection, absent for IPT in household contacts, and rare for second-line treatment (n = 3). Evaluations of diagnostic and screening algorithms were more frequent (n = 19) but geographically clustered and mainly of non-comparative design. Fifty-four studies evaluated ways of delivering these interventions, and nine addressed their cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: There are substantial gaps in published evidence for scale-up for five WHO-recommended TB interventions settings at country level, which for many countries possibly precludes program-wide implementation of these interventions. There is a strong need for rigorous operational research studies to be carried out in programmatic settings to inform on best use of existing and new interventions in TB control.</td>

      <td>Impact of timing of antiretroviral therapy initiation on survival of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions: a cohort analysis from South Africa.</td>
      <td>To determine factors that influence excision treatment outcome and recurrence of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) in women living with HIV infection, we analysed 1848 women who underwent excision treatment of cervical SIL at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. We compared treatment failure defined as presence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I (presence of CIN I or higher at first follow-up after excision treatment) and post-excision recurrence of lesions (at one year or later) between women of HIV-positive, -negative or unknown status and examined factors associated with excision treatment outcome and recurrence. HIV-infected women experienced higher treatment failure than uninfected women (53.8% versus 26.9%, P < 0.001). At treatment failure, more HIV-infected women had low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) compared with uninfected women (64.9% versus 37.3%, P < 0.001). Treatment failure did not differ with the type of excision used in HIV-infected women. HIV-infected women were more likely to experience recurrence of lesions after excision treatment than uninfected women (hazard ratio 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59-2.39; P < 0.001). Antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiated before excision biopsy had a strong protective effect against recurrence (hazard ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.55-0.89; P = 0.006). Our data suggest that women with cervical SIL initiated on ART earlier may be expected to have better long-term excision treatment outcome. Close follow-up should be maintained after cervical excision treatment, especially in a setting of high HIV prevalence.</td>

      <td>Misdiagnosis of tuberculosis in patients with lymphoma.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Since 1970, the incidence of lymphoma, a potentially curable disease, has risen by 80% in the general population and in HIV- positive patients. Given its clinical similarities to tuberculosis (TB), lymphoma may be misdiagnosed and patients treated unnecessarily with potentially harmful TB medication. OBJECTIVES: (i) To identify patients with a histological diagnosis of lymphoma who were previously misdiagnosed with TB; and (ii) to raise awareness of lymphoma as a differential diagnosis when TB has not been confirmed. METHOD: A retrospective study was conducted at Ngwelezane Hospital in rural KwaZulu-Natal, which serves an estimated population of 3 million. Using clinic notes and a questionnaire for patients attending the lymphoma clinic, we identified patients who had undergone failed TB treatment in the 12 months before their histological confirmation of lymphoma. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were included; 18 had been diagnosed with TB in the 12 months preceding the histological confirmation of lymphoma. All these patients subjectively reported TB treatment failure. CONCLUSIONS: Delay in diagnosing lymphoma or its misdiagnosis is an important clinical problem in South Africa, with the condition often misdiagnosed as TB. This subjects patients to incorrect treatment and potential harm. We propose an algorithm for the work-up of patients presenting with lymphadenopathy +/- constitutional symptoms, to assist diagnosis and management in resource-poor settings.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: With the aim of reducing pediatric loss to follow-up (LTFU) from HIV clinical care programs in sub-Saharan Africa, we sought to understand the personal and socio-cultural factors associated with the behavior of caregivers taking HIV-infected and -exposed children for care in western Kenya. METHODS: Between May and August, 2010, in-depth interviews were conducted with 26 purposively sampled caregivers caring for HIV-infected (7), HIV-exposed (17) and HIV-unknown status (2) children, documented as LTFU from an urban and rural HIV care clinic. All were women with a majority (77%) being biological parents. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and content analyzed. RESULTS: Thematic content analysis of the women's perceptions revealed that their decision about routinely taking their children to HIV care involved multiple levels of factors including: (1) intrapersonal: transport costs, food availability, time constraints due to work commitment, disclosure of HIV status for both mother and child, perception that child is healthy and religious beliefs; (2) interpersonal: unsupportive male partner, stigma by the family and family conflicts; (3) community: cultural norms, changing community dynamics and perceived stigma; (4) health care system: clinic location, lack of patient-centered care, delays at the clinic and different appointment schedules (mother and child). Furthermore, the factors across these different levels interacted with each other in a complex way, illustrating the challenges women face in taking their children to HIV care. CONCLUSION: The complexity and interconnectedness of the factors underlying retention of children in HIV care perceived by these women caregivers suggests that interventions to reduce pediatric LTFU need to be holistic and address multiple socio-ecological levels. Patient-centered care that integrates a family-centered approach to HIV pediatric care is recommended.</td>

      <td>The social and clinical characteristics of patients on antiretroviral therapy who are 'lost to follow-up' in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: a prospective study.</td>
      <td>A significant proportion of those initiating antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV infection are lost to follow-up. Causes (including HIV symptoms, quality of life, depression, herbal treatment and alcohol use) for discontinuing ART follow-up in predominantly rural resource-limited settings are not well understood. This is a prospective study of the treatment-naive patients recruited from three (one urban, one-semi-urban and one rural) public hospitals in Uthukela health district in KwaZulu-Natal from October 2007 to February 2008. The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of loss to follow-up or all caused attrition from an ART programme within a cohort followed up for over 12 months. A total of 735 patients (217 men and 518 women) prior to initiating ART completed a baseline questionnaire and 6- and 12-months' follow-up. At 12-months follow-up 557 (75.9%) individuals continued active ART, 177 (24.1%) were all cause attrition, there were 82 deaths (13.8%), 58 (7.9%) transfers, 7 (1.0%) refused participation, 8 (1.1%) were not yet on ART and 22 (3.0%) could not be traced. Death by 12-months of follow-up was associated with lower CD4 cell counts (risk ratio, RR=2.05, confidence intervals, CI=1.20-3.49) and higher depression levels (RR=1.05, CI=1.01-1.09) at baseline assessment. The high early mortality rates indicate that patients are enrolling into ART programmes with far too advanced immunodeficiency; median CD4 cell counts 119 (IQR=59-163). Causes of late access to the ART programme, such as delays in health care access (delayed health care seeking), health system delays, or inappropriate treatment criteria, need to be addressed. Differences in health status (lower CD4 cell counts and higher depression scores) should be taken into account when initiating patients on ART. Treating depression at ART initiation is recommended to improve treatment outcome.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: We assessed the impact of home-based care (HBC) for HIV+ patients, comparing outcomes between two groups of Zambians receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) who lived in villages with and without HBC teams. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using medical charts from Macha Mission Hospital, a hospital providing HIV care in Zambia's rural Southern Province. Date of birth, date of ART initiation, place of residence, sex, body mass index (BMI), CD4+ cell count, and hemoglobin (Hgb) were abstracted. Logistic regression was used to test our hypothesis that HBC was associated with treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Of 655 patients, 523 (80%) were eligible and included in the study. There were 428 patients (82%) with favorable outcomes (alive and on ART) and 95 patients (18%) with unfavorable outcomes (died, lost to follow-up, or stopped treatment). A minority of the 523 eligible patients (n = 84, 16%) lived in villages with HBC available. Living in a village with HBC was not significantly associated with treatment outcomes; 80% of patients in a village with HBC had favorable outcomes, compared to 82% of patients in a village without HBC (P = 0.6 by chi(2)). In bivariable analysis, lower BMI (P<0.001), low CD4+ cell count (P = 0.02), low Hgb concentration (P = 0.02), and older age at ART initiation (P = 0.047) were associated with unfavorable outcomes. In multivariable analysis, low BMI remained associated with unfavorable outcomes (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We did not find that living in a village with HBC available was associated with improved treatment outcomes. We speculate that the ART clinic's rigorous treatment preparation before ART initiation and continuous adherence counseling during ART create a motivated group of patients whose outcomes did not improve with additional HBC support. An alternative explanation is that the quality of the HBC program is suboptimal.</td>

      <td>Monitoring HIV viral load in resource limited settings: still a matter of debate?</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Consequences of lack of viral monitoring in predicting the effects of development of HIV drug resistance mutations during HAART in resource-limited settings (RLS) is still a matter of debate. DESIGN: To assess, among HIV+ patients receiving their first-line HAART, prevalence of virological failure and genotypic resistance mutations pattern in a Medecins Sans Frontieres/Ministry of Health programme in Busia District (Kenya). METHODS: Patients with HAART treatment for >/=12 months were eligible for the study and those with HIV-RNA >/=5000 copies/ml underwent genotypic study. Total HIV-1 RNA from Dried Blood Spots was extracted using Nuclisens method. RESULTS: 926 patients were included. Among 274 (29.6%) patients with detectable viral load, 55 (5.9%) experienced treatment failure (viral load >5.000 copies/ml); 61.8% were female and 10 (18.2%) had clinical failure. Median CD4 cell count was 116 cell/mm3 (IQR: 54-189). Median HIV-RNA was 32,000 copies/ml (IQR: 11000-68000). Eighteen out of 55 (33%) samples could be sequenced on PR and RT genes, with resistance associated mutations (RAMs) in 15 out of 18 samples (83%). Among patients carrying RAMs, 12/15 (81%) harboured RAMs associated to thymidine analogues (TAMs). All of them (100%) showed M184V resistance associated mutation to lamivudine as well as NNRTI's RAMS. CONCLUSIONS: Virological failure rate in resource-limited settings are similar to those observed in developed countries. Resistance mutation patterns were concordant with HAART received by failing patients. Long term detectable viral load confers greater probability of developing resistance and as a consequence, making difficult to find out a cost-effective subsequent treatment regimen.</td>

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) among patients registered for MDR-TB treatment after failure or suspected failure of the standard 6-month regimen for new TB patients (Category I). DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients registered for MDR-TB treatment following failure or suspected failure of Category I. RESULTS: A total of 76 patients were included in the analysis, including 51 Category I treatment failures and 25 suspected Category I treatment failures. The prevalence of resistance to any drug was 92% among the treatment failures and 72% among the suspected failures. The proportion of MDR-TB was respectively 78% and 28% among the treatment failures and suspected failures. Among the subgroup of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients, the proportion of MDR-TB was 84% among failures and 23% among suspected failures. CONCLUSION: DR-TB and MDR-TB were common among patients in whom Category I failed. Early initiation of empiric second-line anti-tuberculosis treatment while awaiting culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) results should be considered for HIV-negative and -positive patients who have failed first-line anti-tuberculosis treatment; patients suspected to be failing a first-line regimen should undergo DST at the end of the intensive phase.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: To assess risk factors for loss to follow-up (LFU) from the IMPAACT P1041 study, an isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis study conducted in southern Africa. DESIGN: Infants in two cohorts, human immunodeficiency virus-infected (HIV+) and HIV-exposed but non-infected (HIV-), were randomized to INH or placebo for 96 weeks. LFU was evaluated at week 96. RESULTS: Of 1351 infants, 12.9% were LFU (10.4% HIV+, 14.7% HIV-); 65% of the HIV+ cohort was asymptomatic. Among HIV+ infants, large household size (>6 vs. <4 members, P = 0.035) and presence of an elder (>/=55 years, P = 0.05) were associated with better retention. Although attenuated in adjusted analysis, these associations held among HIV- infants. Among HIV- infants, having a younger mother increased the risk (P = 0.008) and maternal history of TB reduced the risk of LFU, the latter by nearly 70% (P = 0.048 univariate, 0.09 adjusted). LFU was largely due to inability to contact the participant (58% HIV+, 30% HIV-), and inability to attend the clinic and withdrawal of consent (HIV-). CONCLUSIONS: Household support was an important factor in participant retention, particularly for the non-HIV-infected cohort, as young maternal age was a risk factor for LFU. Retaining study participants from this mobile population can be challenging and may warrant additional support.</td>

In 2010, 1275 women and 470 men between the ages of 16 and 26 were asked about their exposure to people on antiretroviral therapy (ART), sexual risk behavior, HIV status, and beliefs about ART. We used confirmatory factor analysis to develop a 4-item scale of the belief that HIV is a less serious health threat due to ART (reduced-severity optimism) and used a single measure to capture belief in the reduced infectivity of HIV due to ART (reduced-susceptibility optimism). Overall, respondents reported low levels of HIV treatment optimism. Being female and using ART were the largest predictors of both types of treatment optimism. We found a nonlinear relationship between exposure to people on ART and reduced-severity optimism. People who knew someone on ART but did not discuss it with them had lower levels of reduced-severity optimism than people who did not know anyone on ART and people who regularly discussed treatment with someone on ART. In multivariate regression models, HIV treatment optimism was positively associated with all measures of sexual risk behavior among men, but negatively associated with unprotected sex with a nonprimary partner among women. Our findings suggest that the spread of ART in Malawi has not led to widespread HIV treatment optimism. This may reflect the relatively recent spread of ART, the generalized nature of the HIV epidemic, or the fact that access to ART is complicated by structural limitations that delay treatment and limited availability of second-line medicines.</td>

      <td>Metabolic abnormalities and body composition of HIV-infected children on Lopinavir or Nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Few studies have assessed metabolic and body composition alterations in perinatally HIV-infected African children on antiretroviral therapy (ART). We compared metabolic profiles and regional fat of children on ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (lopinavir/ritonavir), lamivudine and stavudine to those switched to nevirapine, lamivudine and stavudine. METHODS: This study evaluated metabolic and body composition outcomes in 156 HIV-infected children completing a randomised trial that assessed the continued use of lopinavir/ritonavir-based ART or switch to nevirapine-based ART in Johannesburg, South Africa (2005-2010). Fasting total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides total and regional body fat (BF) were measured. A clinical assessment for lipodystrophy (LD) was conducted. RESULTS: 156 children (mean age 5.1+/-0.8 years, mean duration of treatment 4.2+/-0.7 years, mean time since randomisation 3.4+/-0.7 years) were enrolled. 85 were randomised to the lopinavir/ritonavir group and 71 to the nevirapine group. The lopinavir/ritonavir group had lower mean HDL (1.3+/-0.4 vs 1.5+/-0.4 mmol/l, p<0.001) and higher mean TC (4.4+/-1.0 vs 4.1+/-0.8 mmol/l, p=0.097), LDL (2.6+/-0.9 vs 2.3+/-0.7 mmol/l, p=0.018) and triglycerides (1.1+/-0.4 vs 0.8+/-0.3 mmol/l, p<0.001). The lopinavir/ritonavir group had more total BF by mean skinfold sum (43+/-11.1 vs 39+/-10.1 mm, p=0.031) and BF% by bioelectrical impedance analysis (17.0+/-7.0 vs 14.1+/-8.0%, p=0.022). Thirteen (8.4%) met criteria for LD. CONCLUSIONS: Unfavourable alterations in lipid profile and triglycerides, and differences in fat are detectable in young HIV-infected South African children receiving lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimens versus those switched to nevirapine-based regimens. Interventions to mitigate these alterations are warranted to reduce long-term cardiovascular disease risk.</td>

      <td>Short and long term retention in antiretroviral care in health facilities in rural Malawi and Zimbabwe.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Despite the successful scale-up of ART services over the past years, long term retention in ART care remains a major challenge, especially in high HIV prevalence and resource-limited settings. This study analysed the short (<12 months) and long (>12 months) term retention on ART in two ART programmes in Malawi (Thyolo district) and Zimbabwe (Buhera district). METHODS: Retention rates at six-month intervals are reported separately among (1) patients since ART initiation and (2) patients who had been on ART for at least 12 months, according to the site of ART initiation and follow-up, using the Kaplan Meier method. 'Retention' was defined as being alive on ART or transferred out, while 'attrition' was defined as dead, lost to follow-up or stopped ART. RESULTS: In Thyolo and Buhera, a total of 12,004 and 9,721 patients respectively were included in the analysis. The overall retention among the patients since ART initiation was 84%, 80% and 77% in Thyolo and 88%, 84% and 82% in Buhera at 6, 12 and 18 months, respectively. In both programmes the largest drop in ART retention was found during the initial 12 months on ART, mainly related to a high mortality rate in the health centres in Thyolo and a high loss to follow-up rate in the hospital in Buhera. Among the patients who had been on ART for at least 12 months, the retention rates leveled out, with 97%, 95% and 94% in both Thyolo and Buhera, at 18, 24 and 30 months respectively. Loss to follow-up was identified as the main contributor to attrition after 12 months on treatment in both programmes. CONCLUSIONS: To better understand the reasons of attrition and adapt the ART delivery care models accordingly, it is advisable to analyse short and long term retention separately, in order to adapt intervention strategies accordingly. During the initial months on ART more medical follow-up, especially for symptomatic patients, is required to reduce mortality. Once stable on ART, however, the ART care delivery should focus on regular drug refill and adherence support to reduce loss to follow up. Hence, innovative life-long retention strategies, including use of new communication technologies, community based interventions and drug refill outside the health facilities are required.</td>

      <td>Virological failure rates and HIV-1 drug resistance patterns in patients on first-line antiretroviral treatment in semirural and rural Gabon.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: As antiretroviral treatment (ART) continues to expand in resource-limited countries, the emergence of HIV drug resistance mutations (DRMs) is challenging in these settings. In Gabon (central Africa), no study has yet reported the virological effectiveness of initial ART given through routine HIV care. METHODS: Following the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, a cross-sectional study with a one-time HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL) measurement was conducted in Gabon to assess virological failure (VF) defined by a VL result >/=1000 copies/ml and DRMs among adult patients living with non-B HIV-1 strains and receiving first-line non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based antiretroviral therapy for at least 12 months. Risk factors associated with VF and DRMs were assessed. RESULTS: Between March 2010 and March 2011, a total of 375 patients were consecutively enrolled from two decentralized (one semirural and one rural) HIV care centres. Median time on ART was 33.6 months (range, 12-107). Overall, the rate of VF was 41.3% (36.4-46.4). Among viremic patients, 56.7% (80/141) had at least one DRM and 37.6% had dual-class resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and NNRTIs. The most frequent DRMs were K103N/S (46.1%) and M184V/I (37.6%). Thymidine analogue mutations were found in 10.6%. Independent risk factors associated with VF were being followed up at the semirural centre (P=0.033), having experienced unstructured treatment interruptions (P=0.0044), and having low CD4+ counts at enrolment (P<0.0001). A longer time on ART (P=0.0008) and being followed up at the rural centre (P=0.021) were risk factors for DRMs. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study conducted in Gabon providing VF rates and DRM patterns in adult patients receiving first-line ART. In sub-Saharan Africa, where NNRTI-based regimens are recommended as the standard for first-line ART, strengthening virological monitoring together with preventing unplanned treatment interruptions are a global public health priority.</td>

      <td>Evaluation of clinical and immunological markers for predicting virological failure in a HIV/AIDS treatment cohort in Busia, Kenya.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In resource-limited settings where viral load (VL) monitoring is scarce or unavailable, clinicians must use immunological and clinical criteria to define HIV virological treatment failure. This study examined the performance of World Health Organization (WHO) clinical and immunological failure criteria in predicting virological failure in HIV patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). METHODS: In a HIV/AIDS program in Busia District Hospital, Kenya, a retrospective, cross-sectional cohort analysis was performed in April 2008 for all adult patients (>18 years old) on ART for >/=12 months, treatment-naive at ART start, attending the clinic at least once in last 6 months, and who had given informed consent. Treatment failure was assessed per WHO clinical (disease stage 3 or 4) and immunological (CD4 cell count) criteria, and compared with virological failure (VL >5,000 copies/mL). RESULTS: Of 926 patients, 123 (13.3%) had clinically defined treatment failure, 53 (5.7%) immunologically defined failure, and 55 (6.0%) virological failure. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of both clinical and immunological criteria (combined) in predicting virological failure were 36.4%, 83.5%, 12.3%, and 95.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis, clinical and immunological criteria were found to perform relatively poorly in predicting virological failure of ART. VL monitoring and new algorithms for assessing clinical or immunological treatment failure, as well as improved adherence strategies, are required in ART programs in resource-limited settings.</td>

      <td>Pediatric response to second-line antiretroviral therapy in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: With improved access to pediatric antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited settings, more children could experience first-line ART treatment failure. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis using electronic medical records from HIV-infected children who initiated ART at McCord Hospital's Sinikithemba Clinic in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, from August 2003 to December 2010. We analyzed all records from children who began second-line ART due to first-line treatment failure. We used logistic regression to compare viral outcomes in Protease Inhibitor (PI)-based versus Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI)-based second-line ART, controlling for time on first-line ART, sex, and whether HIV genotyping guided the regimen change. RESULTS: Of the 880 children who initiated ART during this time period, 80 (9.1%) switched to second-line ART due to therapeutic failure of first-line ART after a median of 95 weeks (IQR 65-147 weeks). Eight (10%) of the failures received NNRTI-based second-line ART, all of whom failed a PI-based first-line regimen. Seventy (87.5%) received PI-based second-line ART, all of whom failed a NNRTI-based first-line regimen. Two children (2.5%) received non-standard dual therapy as second-line ART. Six months after switching ART regimens, the viral suppression rate was significantly higher in the PI group (82%) than in the NNRTI group (29%; p=0.003). Forty-one children (51%) were tested for genotypic resistance prior to switching to second-line ART. There was no significant difference in six month viral suppression (p=0.38) between children with and without genotype testing. CONCLUSION: NNRTI-based second-line ART carries a high risk of virologic failure compared to PI-based second-line ART.</td>

      <td>High prevalence of lipoatrophy in pre-pubertal South African children on antiretroviral therapy: a cross-sectional study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Despite changes in WHO guidelines, stavudine is still used extensively for treatment of pediatric HIV in the developing world. Lipoatrophy in sub-Saharan African children can be stigmatizing and have far-reaching consequences. The severity and extent of lipoatrophy in pre-pubertal children living in sub-Saharan Africa is unknown. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, children who were 3-12 years old, on antiretroviral therapy and pre-pubertal were recruited from a Family HIV Clinic in South Africa. Lipoatrophy was identified and graded by consensus between two HIV pediatricians using a standardized grading scale. A professional dietician performed formal dietary assessment and anthropometric measurements of trunk and limb fat. Previous antiretroviral exposures were recorded. In a Dual-Energy X-ray Absorbtiometry (DXA) substudy body composition was determined in 42 participants. RESULTS: Among 100 recruits, the prevalence of visually obvious lipoatrophy was 36% (95% CI: 27%-45%). Anthropometry and DXA measurements corroborated the clinical diagnosis of lipoatrophy: Both confirmed significant, substantial extremity fat loss in children with visually obvious lipoatrophy, when adjusted for age and sex. Adjusted odds ratio for developing lipoatrophy was 1.9 (95% CI: 1.3 - 2.9) for each additional year of accumulated exposure to standard dose stavudine. Cumulative time on standard dose stavudine was significantly associated with reductions in biceps and triceps skin-fold thickness (p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of visually obvious lipoatrophy in pre-pubertal South African children on antiretroviral therapy is high. The amount of stavudine that children are exposed to needs review. Resources are needed to enable low-and-middle-income countries to provide suitable pediatric-formulated alternatives to stavudine-based pediatric regimens. The standard stavudine dose for children may need to be reduced. Diagnosis of lipoatrophy at an early stage is important to allow timeous antiretroviral switching to arrest progression and avoid stigmatization. Diagnosis using visual grading requires training and experience, and DXA and comprehensive anthropometry are not commonly available. A simple objective screening tool is needed to identify early lipoatrophy in resource-limited settings where specialized skills and equipment are not available.</td>

      <td>Frequency of stavudine substitution due to toxicity in children receiving antiretroviral treatment in sub-Saharan Africa.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Stavudine is a commonly used drug in paediatric antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens. Due to toxicity concerns, however, the drug abacavir has replaced stavudine in first-line paediatric regimens in many countries. We describe the frequency of stavudine toxicity in children receiving ART at a treatment clinic in Soweto, South Africa. METHODS: Data on patient characteristics and outcomes of ART were collected from a cohort of 2222 HIV-infected children initiating ART between 2004 and 2008 when stavudine-containing regimens were routinely recommended. At several time-points after treatment initiation, we estimate the proportion of children where an attending clinician discontinued stavudine due to lipodystrophy, pancreatitis, lactic acidosis or peripheral neuropathy. Factors associated with stavudine-related toxicities were identified. RESULTS: At ART initiation, most children had advanced disease. The majority initiated an efavirenz/lamivudine/stavudine regimen (n = 1422), and 76% of children remained on their initial ART regimen after a median 19.9 months of ART. Replacement of stavudine due to drug toxicity occurred at a rate of 28.8 per 1000 child years on treatment (95% confidence interval = 23.6-35.2). Rates of toxicity increased with treatment duration (in their first year of ART stavudine was replaced in 0.5% of children, but after 3 years stavudine had been changed to abacavir in 12.6% of children). Toxicity was more common in older children and in girls. Lipodystrophy accounted for 87 of 96 toxic events. CONCLUSION: Stavudine-associated toxicity resulting in single-drug substitution was uncommon in this cohort, though its frequency increased steadily with ART duration, especially with lipodystrophy. Where drug options are limited, stavudine remains a relatively well tolerated and effective option for children.</td>

      <td>Multivitamin supplementation in HIV infected adults initiating antiretroviral therapy in Uganda: the protocol for a randomized double blinded placebo controlled efficacy trial.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Use of multivitamin supplements during the pre-HAART era has been found to reduce viral load, enhance immune response, and generally improve clinical outcomes among HIV-infected adults. However, immune reconstitution is incomplete and significant mortality and opportunistic infections occur in spite of HAART. There is insufficient research information on whether multivitamin supplementation may be beneficial as adjunct therapy for HIV-infected individuals taking HAART. We propose to evaluate the efficacy of a single recommended daily allowance (RDA) of micronutrients (including vitamins B-complex, C, and E) in slowing disease progression among HIV-infected adults receiving HAART in Uganda. METHODS/DESIGN: We are using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial study design. Eligible patients are HIV-positive adults aged at least 18 years, and are randomized to receive either a placebo; or multivitamins that include a single RDA of the following vitamins: 1.4 mg B1, 1.4 mg B2, 1.9 mg B6, 2.6 mcg B12, 18 mg niacin, 70 mg C, 10 mg E, and 0.4 mg folic acid. Participants are followed for up to 18 months with evaluations at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. The study is primarily powered to examine the effects on immune reconstitution, weight gain, and quality of life. In addition, we will examine the effects on other secondary outcomes including the risks of development of new or recurrent disease progression event, including all-cause mortality; ARV regimen change from first- to second-line therapy; and other adverse events as indicated by incident peripheral neuropathy, severe anemia, or diarrhea. DISCUSSIONS: The conduct of this trial provides an opportunity to evaluate the potential benefits of this affordable adjunct therapy (multivitamin supplementation) among HIV-infected adults receiving HAART in a developing country setting.

      <td>Performance of frontloading for smear microscopy in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis: a cross-sectional study at a referral hospital in Uganda.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of frontloading and the standard WHO method for diagnosis of pulmonary TB at Mulago Hospital in order to validate the technique in this setting. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in which 229 adult (>/=18 years) TB suspects were consecutively enrolled. Suspects submitted three sputum samples as follows: at initial presentation, one hour after the first sample, and the next morning. The first and next morning samples formed the standard WHO method, while the first and the one hour later samples formed the frontloading method. Sample processing was by the standard N-acetyl L-cystein (NALC)-NaOH method, and fluorescent microscopy was done for both methods, while cultures of the first sample on Lowenstein-Jensen slants acted as a gold standard. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive values for the WHO standard and frontloading methods were compared. RESULTS: The sensitivity of both the frontloading and standard schemes was 91.1% while their specificities were 86.2% and 91.7% respectively. There was excellent agreement between the diagnostic capacity of the two methods (kappa statistic = 0.87, P<0.0001). The positive predictive value for the frontloading scheme was 87.2% and that for the standard approach was 91.9%, while the negative predictive values were 90.4% and 90.9%, respectively. Among the HIV positive patients, frontloading identified 59/79 (74.7%) culture positive samples while the standard approach identified 55/79 (69.6%). In the HIV sero-negative category, on the other hand, front-loading identified 48/110 (43.6%) culture positive samples compared to 45/110 (40.9%) by the standard approach. CONCLUSION: Frontloading based on smear examination of two same-day sputum samples has a similar performance to the current standard method and would not be associated with any significant missed diagnosis. It may therefore be advocated for use in our setting so as to reduce time to completion of diagnosis and patient loss to follow-up.</td>

      <td>Emerging HIV-1 drug resistance after roll-out of antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa.</td>
      <td>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review provides an update of recent data on the development of HIV-1 drug resistance during treatment and its transmission in sub-Saharan Africa after the scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART). RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence is accumulating of a rising prevalence of transmitted HIV drug resistance (TDR), predominantly associated with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), in east and southern Africa. Pretherapy resistance is associated with first-line therapy failure. Accumulation of resistance mutations during first-line failure can be prevented by early detection and timely switching to second-line ART. Important gaps in service delivery and programme performance, associated with resistance development, affect a considerable proportion of ART programmes, particularly with respect to inadequate supply systems and patient retention. The reduction in new HIV infections associated with earlier use of ART is predicted to outweigh the risk of increasing TDR. Future levels of TDR are estimated to be diminished by improving switching practices to second-line regimens. SUMMARY: TDR is on the rise after the recent scale-up of ART in Africa. To prevent the development and spread of drug resistance and sustain the effectiveness of ART programmes, there is a need to improve drug supply systems, patient retention and access to routine viral load monitoring. Enhanced resistance monitoring is warranted in Africa.</td>

      <td>Some factors associated with non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in Tanzania: a case study of Dar es Salaam region.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: Tanzania is one of the nations that are highly affected by HIV/AIDS epidemic. Invention of ARVs (Anti -Retroviral) brought hope of extended life to people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA). Though ARV's are administered in several clinics particularly in Dar es Salaam, there is a problem to adherence. Some factors associated with non-adherence are investigated and ways to optimize adherence are suggested. METHODS: This study was undertaken at three treatment and care clinics in Dar es Salaam. A sample of 197 individuals on ARV and 30 health care providers were interviewed. The sample comprised of 76 % females and 24% males, with mean age 34. About 74% of individuals on ARV were aged between 25 - 45 years. Logistic Regression and survival analysis models were used in the analysis. RESULTS: Individuals on ARV recommended factors responsible for non-adherence as lack of awareness 63.5%, stigma 56%, side effects 53.3%, and costs 28%. Other factors were being busy 25.4%, away from home 21.3%, forgetting 12.2% and ARVs out of stock 10.2%. Proportion of PLHA lost to follow up was 26%. Awareness and side effects were found to be statistically significant, with p-values of 0.042 and 0.068 respectively (alpha = 0.1). The median survival time for individuals on ARV was 42 months (95% CI: 41-44) with survival rate of above 0.7. Log-rank test showed significant differences between the male and female on having a shorter time to death. Females seemed to survive longer than males suggesting that females adhere more to ART than males. CONCLUSION: This calls for emphasis on HIV/AIDS education to the society especially to sensitize men. Another suggestion is that when a woman gets pregnant, both the expectant mother and father should attend maternal clinic so that they both take HIV test so as to increase man's participation.</td>

      <td>Outcomes of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment with early initiation of antiretroviral therapy for HIV co-infected patients in Lesotho.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Although the importance of concurrent treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and HIV co-infection has been increasingly recognized, there have been few studies reporting outcomes of MDR-TB and HIV co-treatment. We report final outcomes of comprehensive, integrated MDR-TB and HIV treatment in Lesotho and examine factors associated with death or treatment failure. METHODS: We reviewed clinical charts of all adult patients who initiated MDR-TB treatment in Lesotho between January 2008 and September 2009. We calculated hazard ratios (HR) and used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to identify predictors of poor outcomes. RESULTS: Of 134 confirmed MDR-TB patients, 83 (62%) were cured or completed treatment, 46 (34%) died, 3 (2%) transferred, 1 (1%) defaulted, and 1 (1%) failed treatment. Treatment outcomes did not differ significantly by HIV status. Among the 94 (70%) patients with HIV co-infection, 53% were already on antiretroviral therapy (ART) before MDR-TB treatment initiation, and 43% started ART a median of 16 days after the start of the MDR-TB regimen. Among HIV co-infected patients who died, those who had not started ART before MDR-TB treatment had a shorter median time to death (80 days vs. 138 days, p=0.065). In multivariable analysis, predictors of increased hazard of failure or death were low and severely low body mass index (HR 2.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-5.93; HR 5.50, 95% CI 2.38-12.69), and a history of working in South Africa (HR 2.37, 95% CI 1.24-4.52). CONCLUSIONS: Favorable outcomes can be achieved in co-infected patients using a community-based treatment model when both MDR-TB and HIV disease are treated concurrently and treatment is initiated promptly.</td>

      <td>Retention of HIV-infected children on antiretroviral treatment in HIV care and treatment programs in Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Tanzania.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Retention of children in HIV care is essential for prevention of disease progression and mortality. METHODS: Retrospective cohort of children (aged 0 to <15 years) initiating antiretroviral treatment (ART) at health facilities in Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Tanzania, from January 2005 to June 2011. Retention was defined as the proportion of children known to be alive and attending care at their initiation facility; lost to follow-up (LTF) was defined as no clinic visit for more than 6 months. Cumulative incidence of ascertained survival and retention after ART initiation was estimated through 24 months using Kaplan-Meier methods. Factors associated with LTF and death were assessed using Cox proportional hazard modeling. RESULTS: A total of 17,712 children initiated ART at 192 facilities: median age was 4.6 years [interquartile ratio (IQR), 1.9-8.3], median CD4 percent was 15% (IQR, 10-20) for children younger than 5 years and 265 cells per microliter (IQR, 111-461) for children aged 5 years or older. At 12 and 24 months, 80% and 72% of children were retained with 16% and 22% LTF and 5% and 7% known deaths, respectively. Retention ranged from 71% to 95% at 12 months and from 62% to 93% at 24 months across countries, respectively, and was lowest for children younger than 1 year (51% at 24 months). LTF and death were highest in children younger than 1 year and children with advanced disease. CONCLUSIONS: Retention was lowest in young children and differed across country programs. Young children and those with advanced disease are at highest risk for LTF and death. Further evaluation of patient- and program-level factors is needed to improve health outcomes.</td>

      <td>Incorporating loss to follow-up in estimates of survival among HIV-infected individuals in sub-Saharan Africa enrolled in antiretroviral therapy programs.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Measuring the survival of human immunodeficiency virus-infected adult patients enrolled in antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs is complicated by short observation periods and loss to follow-up. We synthesized data from treatment cohorts in sub-Saharan Africa to estimate survival over 5 years after initiation of ART. METHODS: We used data on retention, mortality, and loss to follow-up from 34 cohorts, including a total of 102,306 adult patients from 18 sub-Saharan African countries. These data were augmented by data from 13 sub-Saharan African studies tracking death rates among adult patients who were lost to follow-up (LTFU). We used a Poisson regression model to estimate survival over time, incorporating predicted mortality among LTFU patients. RESULTS: Across studies, the median CD4(+) cell count at ART initiation was 104 cells/mm(3), 65% of patients were female, and the median age was 37 years. Survival at 1 year and 5 years were estimated to be 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-0.94) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.36-0.86), respectively, after adjustment for loss to follow-up. The life-years gained by a patient during the 5-year period after starting ART were estimated at 2.1 (95% CI, 1.6-2.3) in the adjusted model, compared with 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1-2.0) if there was 100% mortality among LTFU patients and with 2.4 (1.7-2.7) if there was 0% mortality among LTFU patients. CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for loss to follow-up produces substantial changes in the estimated life-years gained during the first 5 years of ART receipt.</td>

      <td>The clinical and economic impact of genotype testing at first-line antiretroviral therapy failure for HIV-infected patients in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In resource-limited settings, genotype testing at virologic failure on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) may identify patients with wild-type (WT) virus. After adherence counseling, these patients may safely and effectively continue first-line ART, thereby delaying more expensive second-line ART. METHODS: We used the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications International model of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease to simulate a South African cohort of HIV-infected adults at first-line ART failure. Two strategies were examined: no genotype vs genotype, assuming availability of protease inhibitor-based second-line ART. Model inputs at first-line ART failure were mean age 38 years, mean CD4 173/microL, and WT virus prevalence 20%; genotype cost was $300 per test and delay to results, 3 months. Outcomes included life expectancy, per-person costs (2010 US dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (dollars per years of life saved [YLS]). RESULTS: No genotype had a projected life expectancy of 106.1 months, which with genotype increased to 108.3 months. Per-person discounted lifetime costs were $16 360 and $16 540, respectively. Compared to no genotype, genotype was very cost-effective, by international guidance, at $900/YLS. The cost-effectiveness of genotype was sensitive to prevalence of WT virus (very cost-effective when prevalence >/= 12%), CD4 at first-line ART failure, and ART efficacy. Genotype-associated delays in care >/= 5 months decreased survival and made no genotype the preferred strategy. When the test cost was <$100, genotype became cost-saving. CONCLUSIONS: Genotype resistance testing at first-line ART failure is very cost-effective in South Africa. The cost-effectiveness of this strategy will depend on prevalence of WT virus and timely response to genotype results.</td>

      <td>Switch from 200 to 350 CD4 baseline count: what it means to HIV care and treatment programs in Kenya.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: With the increasing population of infected individuals in Africa and constrained resources for care and treatment, antiretroviral management continues to be an important public health challenge. Since the announcement of World Health Organization recommendation and guidelines for initiation of antiretroviral Treatment at CD4 count below 350, many developing countries are adopting this strategy in their country specific guidelines to care and treatment of HIV and AIDS. Despite the benefits to these recommendations, what does this switch from 200 to 350 CD4 count mean in antiretroviral treatment demand? METHODS: A Multi-centre study involving 1376 patients in health care settings in Kenya. CD4 count was carried out by flow cytometry among the HIV infected individuals in Kenya and results analyzed in view of the In-country and the new CD4 recommendation for initiation of antiretroviral treatment. RESULTS: Across sites, 32% of the individual required antiretroviral at <200 CD4 Baseline, 40% at <250 baseline count and 58% based on the new criteria of <350 CD4 Count. There were more female (68%) than Male (32%).Different from <200 and <250 CD4 baseline criteria, over 50% of all age groups required antiretroviral at 350 CD4 baseline. Age groups between 41-62 led in demand for ART. CONCLUSION: With the new guidelines, demand for ARVs has more than doubled with variations noted within regions and age groups. As A result, HIV Care and Treatment Programs should prepare for this expansion for the benefits to be realized.</td>

      <td>Treatment initiation, program attrition and patient treatment outcomes associated with scale-up and decentralization of HIV care in rural Malawi.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To describe patient antiretroviral therapy (cART) outcomes associated with intensive decentralization of services in a rural HIV program in Malawi. METHODS: Longitudinal analysis of data from HIV-infected patients starting cART between August 2001 and December 2008 and of a cross-sectional immunovirological assessment conducted 12 (+/-2) months after therapy start. One-year mortality, lost to follow-up, and attrition (deaths and lost to follow-up) rates were estimated with exact Poisson 95% confidence intervals (CI) by type of care delivery and year of initiation. Association of virological suppression (<50 copies/mL) and immunological success (CD4 gain >/=100 cells/microL), with type of care was investigated using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: During the study period, 4322 cART patients received centralized care and 11,090 decentralized care. At therapy start, patients treated in decentralized health facilities had higher median CD4 count levels (167 vs. 130 cell/microL, P<0.0001) than other patients. Two years after cART start, program attrition was lower in decentralized than centralized facilities (9.9 per 100 person-years, 95% CI: 9.5-10.4 vs. 20.8 per 100 person-years, 95% CI: 19.7-22.0). One year after treatment start, differences in immunological success (adjusted OR=1.23, 95% CI: 0.83-1.83), and viral suppression (adjusted OR=0.80, 95% CI: 0.56-1.14) between patients followed at centralized and decentralized facilities were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: In rural Malawi, 1- and 2-year program attrition was lower in decentralized than in centralized health facilities and no statistically significant differences in one-year immunovirological outcomes were observed between the two health care levels. Longer follow-up is needed to confirm these results.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVES: Stavudine is being phased out because of its mitochondrial toxicity and tenofovir (TDF) is recommended as part of first-line highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in South Africa. A prospective, open-label, randomized controlled trial comparing standard- and low-dose stavudine with TDF was performed to assess early differences in adipocyte mtDNA copy number, gene expression and metabolic parameters in Black South African HIV-infected patients. METHODS: Sixty patients were randomized 1:1:1 to either standard-dose (30-40 mg) or low-dose (20-30 mg) stavudine or TDF (300 mg) each combined with lamivudine and efavirenz. Subcutaneous fat biopsies were obtained at weeks 0 and 4. Adipocyte mtDNA copies/cell and gene expression were measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Markers of inflammation and lipid and glucose metabolism were also assessed. RESULTS: A 29% and 32% decrease in the mean mtDNA copies/cell was noted in the standard-dose (P < 0.05) and low-dose stavudine (P < 0.005) arms, respectively, when compared with TDF at 4 weeks. Nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF1) and mitochondrial cytochrome B (MTCYB) gene expression levels were affected by stavudine, with a significantly (P < 0.05) greater fall in expression observed with the standard, but not the low dose compared with TDF. No significant differences were observed in markers of inflammation and lipid and glucose metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate early mitochondrial depletion among Black South African patients receiving low and standard doses of stavudine, with preservation of gene expression levels, except for NRF1 and MTCYB, when compared with patients on TDF.</td>

      <td>Implementation of Xpert MTB/RIF for routine point-of-care diagnosis of tuberculosis at the primary care level.</td>
      <td>Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) offers rapid detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. However, little is known about routine point-of-care (POC) use in high TB/HIV burden settings. We describe our experiences of launching Xpert as the POC, initial diagnostic for all TB suspects at a primary healthcare clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa. Noted important benefits of POC Xpert were fewer clinic visits, rapid detection of TB and rifampicin resistance, real-time assessment of accompanying household members of new TB cases, and increased staff motivation for TB screening. While Xpert results are available within 2 hours, actual turn-around time was longer for most patients because of sample preparation time and clinic congestion. Consequently, a GX4 instrument did not result in a 16-test capacity during an 8-hour working day, and some patients did not receive same-day results. Loss to follow-up was an unforeseen challenge, overcome by clinic flow changes, marking of clinic files, documenting patients' physical description and locating patients in the clinic by cell phone. Staff with high school education successfully performed the assay after minimal training. Human resource requirements were considerable, with a minimum of 2 staff needed to supervise sputum collection, process sputum, perform assays, and document results for an average of 15 TB suspects daily. POC placement of the instrument transferred logistical responsibilities to the clinic, including quality assurance, maintenance, stock control and cartridge disposal. POC use of Xpert is feasible at the primary healthcare level but must be accompanied by financial, operational and logistical support.</td>

      <td>Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir and rifampicin in HIV and tuberculosis co-infected adults in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In HIV-infected patients receiving rifampicin-based treatment for tuberculosis (TB), the dosage of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is adjusted to prevent sub-therapeutic lopinavir concentrations. In this setting, South African clinicians were advised to administer super-boosted LPV/r (400 mg/400 mg) twice daily, instead of standard dosed LPV/r (400 mg/100 mg) twice daily. We sought to determine--in routine practice--the tolerability and HIV treatment outcomes associated with super-boosted LPV/r compared to unadjusted LPV/r in combination with rifampicin-based TB treatment. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective review of HIV-infected patients who receiving second-line ART with a LPV/r-containing regimen who required concomitant TB treatment. We identified 29 patients; the median age was 36 years (IQR 29-40), 22 (76%) were female, the median CD4 cell count and viral load at first-line ART failure was 86 cells/mm(3) (IQR 21-159) and 39,457 copies/mL (IQR 6,025-157,500), respectively. According to physician preference, 15 (52%) of 29 patients received super-boosted LPV/r (400 mg/400 mg) every 12 hours during TB treatment and 14 (48%) of 29 patients received standard dose LPV/r (400 mg/100 mg) twice daily during TB treatment. Among patients who received super-boosted LPV/r there was a trend towards a higher rate of symptomatic transaminitis (27% vs. 7%; p = 0.3), gastrointestinal toxicity (20% vs. 0%; p = 0.2) and a significantly increased need for treatment discontinuation (47% vs. 7%; p = 0.035. The durability of coadministered treatment was significantly shorter in patients who received super-boosted lopinavir/ritonavir with TB treatment compared to patients who received standard lopinavir/ritonavir dosing (log rank, P = 0.036). The rate of virologic failure was not higher in patients with unadjusted LPV/r dosing. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We observed a high rate of toxicity and need for treatment discontinuation among patients on standard rifampicin-based TB treatment who received super-boosted LPV/r.</td>

The total number of patients identified as "lost to follow up" were 89 of which 14 (15.7%) died. Among those who died, 3 (21.4%) died between the second week and 3 months after ARV initiation. Of those still alive (84.3%; 75/89), 25% (19/75) were still on ARVs, whereas 47 (62.7%) self transferred to other CTCs. Proper patient documentation with actual residence address is a crucial aspect for adherence. Similarly, frequent prompt tracing of patient should be part of any drug interventional programme linking facility and communities.</td>

      <td>Anti-tuberculosis drug resistance is a major problem in tuberculosis (TB) control, particularly multi-drug resistance TB (MDR-TB). The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of primary and acquired anti-TB drug resistance among newly diagnosed pulmonary TB (PTB) and relapse cases. Sputa were collected from newly diagnosed and relapse PTB patients. Drug susceptibility tests (DST) were performed on sputum culture positive isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using resistance ratio method on four first-line anti-TB drugs: rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and streptomycin. Demographic and anthropometric information was collected and HIV status was determined. Of the 523 culture positive isolates, DST results were available for 503 (96%), 455 were new and 48 were relapse cases. Resistance to at least one of the four drugs was observed in 7.8% (39/503) of the isolates, 7.3% (33/455) were new and 12.5% (6/48) were from relapse cases. Mono resistance to isoniazid was higher in both among new 45.5% (15/33) and relapse 50.0% (3/6) cases. Resistance to rifampicin and streptomycin alone was equal 4/33 (12.1%) and only among new cases. Resistance to ethambutol alone was only one among new cases. Overall MDR-TB prevalence was 2.4% (12/503), nine were new and three were relapse cases. MDR-TB was 17.9% (7/39) for rifampicin and isoniazid. Prevalence of HIV was 43.3% and was similar among new and relapse cases and not risk factor for drug resistance. Majority of PTB patients (52%) had BMI below 18 kg/m2. Those with BMI greater than 18 kg/m2 were more likely to develop drug resistance than those with BMI below 18 kg/m2 (P=0.004). With the resurgence of TB and the high prevalence of HIV among TB patients, prevalence of drug resistance is still low both among new and relapses cases. Despite the current low drug resistance, there is a need for continuous monitoring of the resistance.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVES: To assess the proportion of patients lost to programme (died, lost to follow-up, transferred out) between HIV diagnosis and start of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa, and determine factors associated with loss to programme. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed and EMBASE databases for studies in adults. Outcomes were the percentage of patients dying before starting ART, the percentage lost to follow-up, the percentage with a CD4 cell count, the distribution of first CD4 counts and the percentage of eligible patients starting ART. Data were combined using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies from sub-Saharan Africa including 148,912 patients were analysed. Six studies covered the whole period from HIV diagnosis to ART start. Meta-analysis of these studies showed that of the 100 patients with a positive HIV test, 72 (95% CI 60-84) had a CD4 cell count measured, 40 (95% CI 26-55) were eligible for ART and 25 (95% CI 13-37) started ART. There was substantial heterogeneity between studies (P < 0.0001). Median CD4 cell count at presentation ranged from 154 to 274 cells/mul. Patients eligible for ART were less likely to become lost to programme (25%vs. 54%, P < 0.0001), but eligible patients were more likely to die (11%vs. 5%, P < 0.0001) than ineligible patients. Loss to programme was higher in men, in patients with low CD4 cell counts and low socio-economic status and in recent time periods. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring and care in the pre-ART time period need improvement, with greater emphasis on patients not yet eligible for ART.</td>

      <td>CONTEXT: Recent studies have highlighted the increased risk of adverse outcomes among older patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). We report on the associations between older age and adverse outcomes in HIV/AIDS antiretroviral programmes across 17 programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We included data from nine countries: Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. We describe survival probability for progression to death and loss to follow-up for patients initiating ART aged less than 50 years and at least 50 years. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between age (15-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69 and 70-94 years) and adverse outcomes adjusting for confounders identified a priori. RESULTS: Our analysis included 17,561 patients followed for a median of 12 months. The majority (65%) were female and 6672 (38%) were severely immunosuppressed at baseline. Median age at ART initiation was 36.0 years (interquartile range 30.1-42.8); 11.4% of patients were aged at least 50 years. Median gain in CD4 cell count at 6 and 12 months was significantly higher in patients less than 50 years old compared with those at least 50 years (134 vs. 112 cells/mul at 6 months; 170 vs. 139 cells/mul at 12 months; both P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, there was a significant increased risk of mortality beyond 3 months after ART initiation in all age groups of at least 40 years of age compared with less than 40 years [40-49 years adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) 1.59, P < 0.001; 50-59 years aHR 1.58, P = 0.002; 60-69 years aHR 2.63, P < 0.001; 70-94 years aHR 3.64, P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Older age groups represent an important proportion of the overall treatment cohort in these sub-Saharan Africa programmes, and risk of mortality increased as age increased. Future research should be directed at further understanding the reasons for higher mortality, and defining simple interventions that are feasible in highly under-resourced settings to allow for adapted follow-up and care approaches for older age groups.</td>

      <td>Variability of growth in children starting antiretroviral treatment in southern Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Poor growth is an indication for antiretroviral therapy (ART) and a criterion for treatment failure. We examined variability in growth response to ART in 12 programs in Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and South Africa. METHODS: Treatment naive children aged <10 years were included. We calculated weight for age z scores (WAZs), height for age z scores (HAZs), and weight for height z scores (WHZs) up to 3 years after starting ART, by using the World Health Organization standards. Multilevel regression models were used. RESULTS: A total of 17990 children (range, 238-8975) were followed for 36181 person-years. At ART initiation, most children were underweight (50%) and stunted (66%). Lower baseline WAZ, HAZ, and WHZ were the most important determinants of faster catch-up growth on ART. WAZ and WHZ increased rapidly in the first year and stagnated or reversed thereafter, whereas HAZ increased continuously over time. Three years after starting ART, WAZ ranged from -2.80 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.66 to -2.02) to -1.98 (95% CI: -2.41 to -1.48) in children with a baseline z score < -3 and from -0.79 (95% CI: -1.62 to 0.02) to 0.05 (95% CI: -0.42 to 0.51) in children with a baseline WAZ >/= -1. For HAZ, the corresponding range was -2.33 (95% CI: -2.62 to -2.02) to -1.27 (95% CI: -1.58 to -1.00) for baseline HAZ < -3 and -0.24 (95% CI: -0.56 to 0.15) to 0.84 (95% CI: 0.53 to 1.16) for HAZ >/= -1. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a sustained growth response and catch-up growth in children with advanced HIV disease treated with ART, normal weights and heights are not achieved over 3 years of ART.</td>

      <td>Implementing early infant diagnosis of HIV infection at the primary care level: experiences and challenges in Malawi.</td>
      <td>PROBLEM: Malawi's national guidelines recommend that infants exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) be tested at 6 weeks of age. Rollout of services for early infant diagnosis has been limited and has resulted in the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in very few infants. APPROACH: An early infant diagnosis programme was launched. It included education of pregnant women on infant testing, community sensitization, free infant testing at 6 weeks of age, active tracing of HIV-positive infants and referral for treatment and care. LOCAL SETTING: The programme was established in two primary care facilities in Blantyre, Malawi. RELEVANT CHANGES: Of 1214 HIV-exposed infants, 71.6% presented for early diagnosis, and 14.5% of those who presented tested positive for HIV. Further testing of 103 of these 126 apparently HIV-positive infants confirmed infection in 88; the other 15 results were false positives. The initial polymerase chain reaction testing of dried blood spots had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 85.4%. Despite active tracing, only 87.3% (110/126) of the mothers of infants who initially tested positive were told their infants' test results. ART was initiated in 58% of the infants with confirmed HIV infection. LESSONS LEARNT: Early infant diagnosis of HIV infection at the primary care level in a resource-poor setting is challenging. Many children in the HIV diagnosis and treatment programme were lost to follow-up at various stages. Diagnostic tools with higher PPV and point-of-care capacity and better infrastructures for administering ART are needed to improve the management of HIV-exposed and HIV-infected infants.</td>

      <td>HIV disclosure, sexual negotiation and male involvement in prevention-of-mother-to-child-transmission in South Africa.</td>
      <td>HIV-seroconversion during pregnancy is a serious concern throughout South Africa, where an estimated 35 to 40% of pregnant women have HIV/AIDS and drop-out is high at all stages of the prevention-of-mother-to-child-transmission (PMTCT) process. The likelihood of PMTCT success may be linked to partner support, yet male involvement in antenatal care remains low. This qualitative study examined the influence of pregnant couples' expectations, experiences and perceptions on sexual communication and male involvement in PMTCT. A total of 119 couples participated in a comprehensive intervention in 12 antenatal clinics throughout South Africa. Data were collected between December 2010 to June 2011 and analysed using a grounded theory approach. Findings point to the importance of sexual communication as a factor influencing PMTCT male involvement. Analysis of themes lends support to improving communication between couples, encouraging dialogue among men and increasing male involvement in PMTCT to bridge the gap between knowledge and sexual behaviour change.</td>

      <td>Gender differences in survival among adult patients starting antiretroviral therapy in South Africa: a multicentre cohort study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Increased mortality among men on antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been documented but remains poorly understood. We examined the magnitude of and risk factors for gender differences in mortality on ART. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Analyses included 46,201 ART-naive adults starting ART between January 2002 and December 2009 in eight ART programmes across South Africa (SA). Patients were followed from initiation of ART to outcome or analysis closure. The primary outcome was mortality; secondary outcomes were loss to follow-up (LTF), virologic suppression, and CD4+ cell count responses. Survival analyses were used to examine the hazard of death on ART by gender. Sensitivity analyses were limited to patients who were virologically suppressed and patients whose CD4+ cell count reached >200 cells/microl. We compared gender differences in mortality among HIV+ patients on ART with mortality in an age-standardised HIV-negative population. Among 46,201 adults (65% female, median age 35 years), during 77,578 person-years of follow-up, men had lower median CD4+ cell counts than women (85 versus 110 cells/microl, p<0.001), were more likely to be classified WHO stage III/IV (86 versus 77%, p<0.001), and had higher mortality in crude (8.5 versus 5.7 deaths/100 person-years, p<0.001) and adjusted analyses (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.31, 95% CI 1.22-1.41). After 36 months on ART, men were more likely than women to be truly LTF (AHR 1.20, 95% CI 1.12-1.28) but not to die after LTF (AHR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86-1.25). Findings were consistent across all eight programmes. Virologic suppression was similar by gender; women had slightly better immunologic responses than men. Notably, the observed gender differences in mortality on ART were smaller than gender differences in age-standardised death rates in the HIV-negative South African population. Over time, non-HIV mortality appeared to account for an increasing proportion of observed mortality. The analysis was limited by missing data on baseline HIV disease characteristics, and we did not observe directly mortality in HIV-negative populations where the participating cohorts were located. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected men have higher mortality on ART than women in South African programmes, but these differences are only partly explained by more advanced HIV disease at the time of ART initiation, differential LTF and subsequent mortality, and differences in responses to treatment. The observed differences in mortality on ART may be best explained by background differences in mortality between men and women in the South African population unrelated to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

      <td>A cost analysis study calculates resources needed to deliver an intervention and can provide useful information on affordability for service providers and policy-makers. We conducted cost analyses of both a peer health worker (PHW) and a mHealth (mobile phone) support intervention. Excluding supervisory staffing costs, total yearly costs for the PHW intervention was $8475, resulting in a yearly cost per patient of $8.74, per virologic failure averted cost of $189, and per patient lost to follow-up averted cost of $1025. Including supervisory staffing costs increased total yearly costs to $14,991. Yearly costs of the mHealth intervention were an additional $1046, resulting in a yearly cost per patient of $2.35. In a threshold analysis, the PHW intervention was found to be cost saving if it was able to avert 1.50 patients per year from switching to second-line antiretroviral therapy. Other AIDS care programs may find these intervention costs affordable.</td>

      <td>A retrospective study of Human Immunodeficiency Virus transmission, mortality and loss to follow-up among infants in the first 18 months of life in a prevention of mother-to-child transmission programme in an urban hospital in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Follow up of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-exposed infants is an important component of Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) programmes in order to ascertain infant outcomes post delivery. We determined HIV transmission, mortality and loss to follow-up (LTFU) of HIV-exposed infants attending a postnatal clinic in an urban hospital in Durban, South Africa. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of infants born to women in the PMTCT programme at McCord Hospital, where mothers paid a fee for service. Data were abstracted from patient records for live-born infants delivered between 1 May 2008 and 31 May 2009. The infants' LTFU status and age was based on the date of the last visit. HIV transmission was calculated as a proportion of infants followed and tested at six weeks. Mortality rates were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier (K-M), with censoring on 15 January 2010, LTFU or death. RESULTS: Of 260 infants, 155 (59.6%) remained in care at McCord beyond 28 weeks: one died at < 28 days, three died between one to six months; 34 were LTFU within seven days, 60 were LTFU by six months. K-M mortality rate: 1.7% at six months (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.6% to 4.3%). Of 220 (83%) infants tested for HIV at six weeks, six (2.7%, 95% CI: 1.1% to 5.8%) were HIV-infected. In Cox regression analysis, late antenatal attendance (>/= 28 weeks gestation) relative to attending in the first trimester was a predictor for infant LTFU (adjusted hazards ratio = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.0 to 5.1; p = 0.044). CONCLUSION: This urban PMTCT programme achieved low transmission rates at six weeks, but LTFU in the first six months limited our ability to examine HIV transmission up to 18 months and determinants of mortality. The LTFU of infants born to women who attended antenatal care at 28 weeks gestation or later emphasizes the need to identify late antenatal attendees for follow up care to educate and support them regarding the importance of follow up care for themselves and their infants.</td>

      <td>Recall of lost-to-follow-up pre-antiretroviral therapy patients in the Eastern Cape: effect of mentoring on patient care.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In 2011 an experienced HIV nurse from the UK was deployed for 3 months to act as a mentor to nurses learning to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) in primary care clinics in a small town in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. METHODS: A review of existing pre-ART patient files (N=286) was carried out and lost-to-follow-up (LTFU) HIV patients were recalled. RESULTS: Only 24% of patients had attended the clinics within the preceding 6 months and 20% had not attended for longer than 2 years. Two lay counsellors visited 222 patients to encourage them to return to care; 65/286 (23%) were untraceable, 11/286 (4%) had relocated, 30/286 (10%) declined, and 8/286 (3%) had died. In the 6 weeks following recall, 51/286 patients (18%) returned to the clinics. CD4 count testing was repeated and screening for tuberculosis (TB) and other opportunistic infections was performed for all patients; ART was initiated in 13/51 (25%), 1 patient tested positive for TB, and isionazid (INH) prophylaxis was initiated in 23/51 (45%). The cost of recall was R130/patient. Within 6 months, all clinics began providing full ART services, 17 professional nurses were mentored and they initiated ART in 55 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Mentoring plays an important role in professional nurse training and support. Recall of LTFU patients is feasible and effective in improving ART services in rural settings.</td>

      <td>Universal access to HIV treatment versus universal 'test and treat': transmission, drug resistance & treatment costs.</td>
      <td>In South Africa (SA) universal access to treatment for HIV-infected individuals in need has yet to be achieved. Currently ~1 million receive treatment, but an additional 1.6 million are in need. It is being debated whether to use a universal 'test and treat' (T&T) strategy to try to eliminate HIV in SA; treatment reduces infectivity and hence transmission. Under a T&T strategy all HIV-infected individuals would receive treatment whether in need or not. This would require treating 5 million individuals almost immediately and providing treatment for several decades. We use a validated mathematical model to predict impact and costs of: (i) a universal T&T strategy and (ii) achieving universal access to treatment. Using modeling the WHO has predicted a universal T&T strategy in SA would eliminate HIV within a decade, and (after 40 years) cost ~$10 billion less than achieving universal access. In contrast, we predict a universal T&T strategy in SA could eliminate HIV, but take 40 years and cost ~$12 billion more than achieving universal access. We determine the difference in predictions is because the WHO has under-estimated survival time on treatment and ignored the risk of resistance. We predict, after 20 years, ~2 million individuals would need second-line regimens if a universal T&T strategy is implemented versus ~1.5 million if universal access is achieved. Costs need to be realistically estimated and multiple evaluation criteria used to compare 'treatment as prevention' with other prevention strategies. Before implementing a universal T&T strategy, which may not be sustainable, we recommend striving to achieve universal access to treatment as quickly as possible. We predict achieving universal access to treatment would be a very effective 'treatment as prevention' approach and bring the HIV epidemic in SA close to elimination, preventing ~4 million infections after 20 years and ~11 million after 40 years.</td>

      <td>The immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome after antiretroviral therapy initiation in patients with tuberculosis: findings from the SAPiT trial.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Concerns about the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) remain a barrier to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation during antituberculosis treatment in co-infected patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess IRIS incidence, severity, and outcomes relative to the timing of ART initiation in patients with HIV-related tuberculosis. DESIGN: Randomized, open-label clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00398996) SETTING: An outpatient clinic in Durban, South Africa. PATIENTS: 642 patients co-infected with HIV and tuberculosis. MEASUREMENTS: In a secondary analysis of the SAPiT (Starting Antiretroviral Therapy at Three Points in Tuberculosis) trial, IRIS was assessed in patients randomly assigned to initiate ART within 4 weeks of tuberculosis treatment initiation (early integrated treatment group), within 4 weeks of completion of the intensive phase of tuberculosis treatment (late integrated treatment group), or within 4 weeks after tuberculosis therapy completion (sequential treatment group). The syndrome was defined as new-onset or worsening symptoms, signs, or radiographic manifestations temporally related to treatment initiation, accompanied by a treatment response. Severity of IRIS, hospitalization, and time to resolution were monitored. RESULTS: Incidence of IRIS was 19.5 (n = 43), 7.5 (n = 18), and 8.1 (n = 19) per 100 person-years in the early integrated, late integrated, and sequential treatment groups, respectively. Among patients with a baseline CD4+ count less than 0.050 x 109 cells/L, IRIS incidence was 45.5, 9.7, and 19.7 per 100 person-years in the early integrated, late integrated, and sequential treatment groups, respectively. Incidence of IRIS was higher in the early integrated treatment group than in the late integrated (incidence rate ratio, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.5 to 4.8]; P < 0.001) or sequential (incidence rate ratio, 2.4 [CI, 1.4 to 4.4]; P < 0.001) treatment groups. More severe IRIS cases occurred in the early integrated treatment group than in the other 2 groups (35% vs. 19%; P = 0.179), and patients in the early integrated treatment group had significantly higher hospitalization rates (42% vs. 14%; P = 0.007) and longer time to resolution (70.5 vs. 29.0 days; P = 0.001) than patients in the other 2 groups. LIMITATIONS: It was not possible to assess IRIS in more patients in the sequential treatment group (n = 74) than in the late integrated (n = 50) and early integrated (n = 32) treatment groups because of loss to follow-up, withdrawal, or death within 6 months of scheduled ART initiation. This study did not assess IRIS risk in nonambulatory patients or in those with extrapulmonary and smear-negative tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: Initiation of ART in early stages of tuberculosis treatment resulted in significantly higher IRIS rates, longer time to resolution, and more severe cases of IRIS requiring hospitalization. These findings are particularly relevant to patients initiating ART with a CD4+ count less than 0.050 x 109 cells/L, given the increased survival benefit of early ART initiation in this group.

      <td>Early loss to follow-up of recently diagnosed HIV-infected adults from routine pre-ART care in a rural district hospital in Kenya: a cohort study.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate and predictors of early loss to follow-up (LTFU) for recently diagnosed HIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-ineligible adults in rural Kenya. METHODS: Prospective cohort study. Clients registering for HIV care between July 2008 and August 2009 were followed up for 6 months. Baseline data were used to assess predictors of pre-ART LTFU (not returning for care within 2 months of a scheduled appointment), LTFU before the second visit and LTFU after the second visit. Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with LTFU before the second visit, while Cox regression was used to assess predictors of time to LTFU and LTFU after the second visit. RESULTS: Of 530 eligible clients, 178 (33.6%) were LTFU from pre-ART care (11.1/100 person-months). Of these, 96 (53.9%) were LTFU before the second visit. Distance (>5 km vs. <1 km: adjusted hazard ratio 2.6 [1.9-3.7], P < 0.01) and marital status (married vs. single: 0.5 [0.3-0.6], P < 0.01) independently predicted pre-ART LTFU. Distance and marital status were independently associated with LTFU before the second visit, while distance, education status and seasonality showed weak evidence of predicting LTFU after the second visit. HIV disease severity did not predict pre-ART LTFU. CONCLUSIONS: A third of recently diagnosed HIV-infected, ART-ineligible clients were LTFU within 6 months of registration. Predictors of LTFU among ART-ineligible clients are different from those among clients on ART. These findings warrant consideration of an enhanced pre-ART care package aimed at improving retention and timely ART initiation.</td>

      <td>Cost-effectiveness of early initiation of first-line combination antiretroviral therapy in Uganda.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Ugandan national guidelines recommend initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) at CD4+ T cell (CD4) count below 350 cell/mul, but the implementation of this is limited due to availability of medication. However, cART initiation at higher CD4 count increases survival, albeit at higher lifetime treatment cost. This analysis evaluates the cost-effectiveness of initiating cART at a CD4 count between 250-350 cell/mul (early) versus <250 cell/mul (delayed). METHODS: Life expectancy of cART-treated patients, conditional on baseline CD4 count, was modeled based on published literature. First-line cART costs $192 annually, with an additional $113 for patient monitoring. Delaying initiation of cART until the CD4 count falls below 250 cells/mul would incur the cost of the bi-annual CD4 count tests and routine maintenance care at $85 annually. We compared lifetime treatment costs and disability adjusted life-expectancy between early vs. delayed cART for ten baseline CD4 count ranges from 250-350 cell/mul. All costs and benefits were discounted at 3% annually. RESULTS: Treatment delay varied from 6-18 months. Early cART initiation increased life expectancy from 1.5-3.5 years and averted 1.33-3.10 disability adjusted life years (DALY's) per patient. Lifetime treatment costs were $4,300-$5,248 for early initiation and $3,940-$4,435 for delayed initiation. The cost/DALY averted of the early versus delayed start ranged from $260-$270. CONCLUSIONS: In HIV-positive patients presenting with CD4 count between 250-350 cells/mul, immediate initiation of cART is a highly cost-effective strategy using the recommended one-time per capita GDP threshold of $490 reported for Uganda. This would constitute an efficient use of scarce health care funds.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and describe the resistance patterns in patients commencing antiretroviral therapy (ART) in an HIV clinic in Durban, South Africa. DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study. METHODS: Consecutive HIV-infected adults (>/= 18y/o) initiating HIV care were enrolled from May 2007-May 2008, regardless of signs or symptoms of active TB. Prior TB history and current TB treatment status were self-reported. Subjects expectorated sputum for culture (MGIT liquid and 7H11 solid medium). Positive cultures were tested for susceptibility to first- and second-line anti-tuberculous drugs. The prevalence of drug-resistant TB, stratified by prior TB history and current TB treatment status, was assessed. RESULTS: 1,035 subjects had complete culture results. Median CD4 count was 92/microl (IQR 42-150/microl). 267 subjects (26%) reported a prior history of TB and 210 (20%) were receiving TB treatment at enrollment; 191 (18%) subjects had positive sputum cultures, among whom the estimated prevalence of resistance to any antituberculous drug was 7.4% (95% CI 4.0-12.4). Among those with prior TB, the prevalence of resistance was 15.4% (95% CI 5.9-30.5) compared to 5.2% (95% CI 2.1-8.9) among those with no prior TB. 5.1% (95% CI 2.4-9.5) had rifampin or rifampin plus INH resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of TB resistance to at least one drug was 7.4% among adults with positive TB cultures initiating ART in Durban, South Africa, with 5.1% having rifampin or rifampin plus INH resistance. Improved tools for diagnosing TB and drug resistance are urgently needed in areas of high HIV/TB prevalence.</td>

      <td>Performance of the PointCare NOW system for CD4 counting in HIV patients based on five independent evaluations.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Point-of-care (POC) CD4 testing can improve access to treatment by enabling decentralization and reducing patient loss-to-follow-up. As new POC CD4 technologies become available, their performance should be assessed before widespread deployment. This study reports the findings of five independent evaluations of the PointCare NOW CD4 system. MATERIALS/METHODS: Evaluations were conducted in Southern Africa (Mozambique, South Africa) and North America (Canada, USA). 492 blood samples (55 from HIV-negative blood donors and 437 from HIV-infected patients, including 20 children aged between 12 and 59 months) were tested with both the PointCare NOW and reference flow cytometry instruments. Assessment of bias, precision and levels of clinical misclassification for absolute and percent CD4 count was conducted. RESULTS: PointCare NOW significantly overestimated CD4 absolute counts with a mean relative bias of +35.0%. Bias was greater in samples with CD4 counts below </= 350 cells/microl (+51.3%) than in the CD4 >350 cells/microl stratum (15.1%). Bias in CD4% had a similar trend with an overall relative mean bias of +25.6% and a larger bias for low CD4 stratum (+40.2%) than the higher CD4 stratum (+5.8%). Relative bias for CD4% in children was -6.8%. In terms of repeatability, PointCare NOW had a coefficient of variation of 11%. Using a threshold of 350 cells/microl, only 47% of patients who qualified for antiretroviral therapy with reference CD4 testing, would have been eligible for treatment with PointCare NOW test results. This was 39% using a 200 cells/microl threshold. Agreement with infant samples was higher, with 90% qualifying at a 25% eligibility threshold. CONCLUSION: The performance of the PointCare NOW instrument for absolute and percent CD4 enumeration was inadequate for HIV clinical management in adults. In children, the small sample size was not large enough to draw a conclusion. This study also highlights the importance of independent evaluation of new diagnostic technology platforms before deployment.</td>

      <td>Managing HIV-infected children in a low-resource, public clinic: a comparison of nurse vs. clinical officer practices in ART refill, calculation of adherence and subsequent appointments.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In Malawi, as in other sub-Saharan African countries, nurses manage patients of all ages on antiretroviral treatment(ART). Nurse management of children is rarely studied.We compare ART prescribing between nurses and clinical officers during routine clinic visits at an urban, public clinic to inform policy in paediatric ART management. METHODS: Caregivers of children on first-line ART provided information about visit dates, pill counts, ART dosage and formulation to a nurse and, subsequently, to a clinical officer. Nurses and clinical officers independently calculated adherence, dosage based on body weight, and set next appointment date. Clinical officers, but not nurses, accessed an electronic data system that made the calculations for them based on information from prior visits, actual and expected pill consumption, and standard drug supplies. Nurses calculated with pen and paper. For numerical variables, Bland-Altman graphs plot differences of each nurse clinical officer pair against the mean, show the 95% limits of agreement (LoA), and also show the mean difference across all reviews. Kappa statistics assess agreement for categorical variables. RESULTS: A total of 704 matched nurse clinical officer reviews of 367 children attending the ART clinics between March and July 2010 were analyzed. Eight nurses and 18 clinical officers were involved; two nurses and five clinical officers managed 100 visits or more. Overall, there was a good agreement between the two cadres. Differences between nurses and clinical officers were within narrow LoA and mean differences showed little deviation from zero, indicating little skewing towards one cadre. LoA of adherence and morning and evening ART dosages varied from -24% to 24%, -0.4 to 0.4 and -0.41 to 0.40 tablets,respectively, with mean differences (95% CI) of 0.003 (-0.9, 0.91), -0.005 (-0.02, 0.01) and -0.009 (-0.02, 0.01). Next appointment calculations differed more between cadres with LoA from -40 to 42 days [mean difference: 0.96 days (95%CI:-0.6 to 2.5)], but agreement in the ART formulation prescribed was very good (kappa 0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Nurses' ART prescribing practices and calculations of adherence and next appointments are similar to clinical officers, although clinical officers used an electronic system. Our findings support the decision of Malawi's health officials to utilize nurses to manage paediatric ART patients.</td>

      <td>Cost-effectiveness of tenofovir instead of zidovudine for use in first-line antiretroviral therapy in settings without virological monitoring.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The most recent World Health Organization (WHO) antiretroviral treatment guidelines recommend the inclusion of zidovudine (ZDV) or tenofovir (TDF) in first-line therapy. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with emphasis on emerging patterns of drug resistance upon treatment failure and their impact on second-line therapy. METHODS: We used a stochastic simulation of a generalized HIV-1 epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa to compare two strategies for first-line combination antiretroviral treatment including lamivudine, nevirapine and either ZDV or TDF. Model input parameters were derived from literature and, for the simulation of resistance pathways, estimated from drug resistance data obtained after first-line treatment failure in settings without virological monitoring. Treatment failure and cost effectiveness were determined based on WHO definitions. Two scenarios with optimistic (no emergence; base) and pessimistic (extensive emergence) assumptions regarding occurrence of multidrug resistance patterns were tested. RESULTS: In the base scenario, cumulative proportions of treatment failure according to WHO criteria were higher among first-line ZDV users (median after six years 36% [95% simulation interval 32%; 39%]) compared with first-line TDF users (31% [29%; 33%]). Consequently, a higher proportion initiated second-line therapy (including lamivudine, boosted protease inhibitors and either ZDV or TDF) in the first-line ZDV user group 34% [31%; 37%] relative to first-line TDF users (30% [27%; 32%]). At the time of second-line initiation, a higher proportion (16%) of first-line ZDV users harboured TDF-resistant HIV compared with ZDV-resistant viruses among first-line TDF users (0% and 6% in base and pessimistic scenarios, respectively). In the base scenario, the incremental cost effectiveness ratio with respect to quality adjusted life years (QALY) was US$83 when TDF instead of ZDV was used in first-line therapy (pessimistic scenario: US$ 315), which was below the WHO threshold for high cost effectiveness (US$ 2154). CONCLUSIONS: Using TDF instead of ZDV in first-line treatment in resource-limited settings is very cost-effective and likely to better preserve future treatment options in absence of virological monitoring.</td>

      <td>Early diagnosis and treatment of ankylosing spondylitis in Africa and the Middle East.</td>
      <td>Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is the prototype for spondyloarthritis primarily affecting young men. Geographic and ethnic variations exist in the prevalence and severity of AS and relate to the wide disparity in the frequency of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27, a major genetic risk factor. The strength of the disease association with HLA-B27 is lower in most Arab populations (25-75 %) than in Western European populations (>90 %), and there is no association in sub-Saharan Africa, where the prevalence of HLA-B27 is <1 %. Other epidemiologic differences between European and African populations are the apparent later age at presentation in sub-Saharan Africa, and the high rate of spondyloarthropathies associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Diagnosis of AS is often delayed 8-10 years; potential reasons for the delay in Africa and the Middle East include low awareness among physicians and patients, the requirement for radiographic evidence of sacroiliitis for diagnosis, and limited access to magnetic resonance imaging in some countries. Treatment should be initiated early to prevent or reduce skeletal deformity and physical disability. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective first-line treatment and anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha drugs are indicated for patients who have an inadequate response to first-line therapy. In Africa and the Middle East, such treatments may be precluded either by cost or contraindicated because of the high prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection. Research is sorely needed to develop cost-effective tools to diagnose AS early as well as effective, inexpensive, and safe treatments for these developing regions.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: To determine mortality and immune status improvement in HIV-infected pediatric patients on antiretroviral treatment (ART) in Malawi, Lesotho, and Swaziland. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients aged <12 years at ART initiation at 3 sites in sub-Saharan Africa between 2004 and 2009. Twelve-month and overall mortality were estimated, and factors associated with mortality and immune status improvement were evaluated. RESULTS: Included in the study were 2306 patients with an average follow-up time on ART of 2.3 years (interquartile range 1.5-3.1 years). One hundred four patients (4.5%) died, 9.0% were lost to follow-up, and 1.3% discontinued ART. Of the 104 deaths, 77.9% occurred in the first year of treatment with a 12-month mortality rate of 3.5%. The overall mortality rate was 2.25 deaths/100 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.84-2.71). Increased 12-month mortality was associated with younger age; <6 months (hazard ratio [HR] = 8.11, CI 4.51-14.58), 6 to <12 months (HR = 3.43, CI 1.96-6.02), and 12 to <36 months (HR = 1.92, CI 1.16-3.19), and World Health Organization stage IV (HR = 4.35, CI 2.19-8.67). Immune status improvement at 12 months was less likely in patients with advanced disease and age <12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Despite challenges associated with pediatric ART in developing countries, low mortality and good treatment outcomes can be achieved. However, outcomes are worse in younger patients and those with advanced disease at the time of ART initiation, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and treatment.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: We describe the presentation and outcome of care among patients with tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection from a prospective observational cohort in Uganda. METHODS: We analysed basic demographics, CD4+ counts, time of initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), clinical and haematological parameters and outcome of care of 386 patients enrolled between February 2007 and March 2010. RESULTS: At presentation, 56.7% of the patients were sputum-positive, 89.9% had new TB infection, 62.7% had wasting, 78.7% were anaemic, 72.1% had a CD4+ count of <200 cells/mm(3), 20.2% had pneumonia, 50.3% had oral thrush and 1.3% had Kaposi's sarcoma. Patients developing TB within 3 months of starting ART were less likely to have wasting, to be anaemic or to have a CD4+ count of <100 cells/mm(3). The cure, default and death rates were respectively 54.3%, 24% and 16%. At 8 months, 53 (13.7%) were confirmed dead, 119 (30.8%) were lost to follow-up, 28 (7.3%) were transferred out and 1 (0.3%) had treatment failure. Mortality and loss to follow-up were associated with failure to start ART and having a CD4+ count of <200 cells/mm(3). CONCLUSION: In Uganda, TB-HIV patients present with severe immune suppression and are at increased risk of death and loss to follow-up, particularly those not on ART. There is need for early identification and improved follow-up of TB-HIV co-infected patients.</td>

      <td>The rates of virological failure (VF) and HIV-1 drug resistance were evaluated in a cross-sectional study in HIV-1-infected children living in Dakar, and taking antiretroviral treatment (ART) according to WHO recommendations. The plasma HIV-1 RNA load was measured using the Abbott m2000 RealTime HIV-1 assay. The full-length protease gene and partial reverse transcriptase gene were sequenced, and resistance mutations were assessed by reference to the Stanford University HIV drug resistance database. Of 125 included children (median age, 7 years) taking first-line ART for a median duration of 20 months, 82 (66%) showed detectable HIV-1 RNA load, and 70 (56%) met the 2010 revised WHO criteria of VF (defined as plasma HIV-1 RNA load >/=3.7 log(10) copies/ml). Drug resistance results were available for 52 children with plasma HIV-1 RNA load >/=3.0 log(10) copies/ml, and viruses carrying resistance mutations were found in 48 (92%) children. Among these 48, mutations conferring resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) or non-NRTIs (NNRTIs) were found in 42 (88%) and 47 (99%) children, respectively. The NRTI-resistant viruses harbored the M184V/I (95%), Q151M (2%), and thymidine-analogue mutations (40%), and the NNRTI-resistant viruses harbored the K103N (34%), Y181C (32%), G190A (23%), and K101E (21%) mutations. A high rate (56%) of VF was demonstrated in Senegalese children after 20 months of first-line ART and therapeutic failure was assessed by the presence of antiretroviral drug resistance mutations in 9 out of 10 children in VF. These findings point out the difficulties of optimizing ART in children living in sub-Saharan Africa, and the crucial need of laboratory monitoring reinforcement.</td>

      <td>Tenofovir use and renal insufficiency among pregnant and general adult population of HIV-infected, ART-naive individuals in Lilongwe, Malawi.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The Malawian government recently changed its prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) regimen and plans to change its first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen to Tenofovir(TDF)/Lamivudine/Efavirenz as a fixed-dose combination tablet. Implementation could be challenging if baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) screening were required to assess renal function prior to TDF therapy. Our goal is to determine predictors of CrCl<50 ml/min among HIV-infected, ART-naive individuals. METHODOLOGY: Data on HIV-infected, ART-naive adults screened for enrollment into 5 HIV clinical trials in Lilongwe, Malawi were combined for a pooled analysis of predictors for CrCl<50 ml/min. CrCl was derived from the Cockroft-Gault equation. Multivariable logistic regression modeled the association of age, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin, CD4 cell count <350 cells/mm(3), gender, and pregnancy with CrCl<50 ml/min. RESULTS: The analysis included 3508 patients with values for creatinine clearance. Most subjects were female (90.6%) with a median age of 26 years (IQR 22-29). The median CD4 cell count was 444 (IQR 298.0-561.0), and 85.2% percent of women in our study were pregnant. Few patients had CrCl<50 ml/min (n = 38, 1.1%). A BMI less than 18.5 in non-pregnant females (OR = 8.87, 95% CI = 2.45-32.09)) was associated with CrCl<50 ml/min. Hemoglobin level higher than 10 g/dL in males (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.56-0.86) and non-pregnant females (OR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.04-0.97) was protective against CrCl<50 ml/min. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate few patients would be excluded from a TDF-based antiretroviral regimen, suggesting baseline creatinine clearance assessment may not be necessary for implementation. However, in ART settings individuals with low BMI or anemia could potentially be at increased risk for lower CrCl.</td>

      <td>Adoption of new HIV treatment guidelines and drug substitutions within first-line as a measure of quality of care in rural Lesotho: health centers and hospitals compared.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: In 2007, Lesotho launched new national antiretroviral treatment (ART) guidelines, prioritising tenofovir and zidovudine over stavudine as a backbone together with lamivudine. We compared the rate of adoption of these new guidelines and substitution of first-line drugs by health centers (HC) and hospitals in two catchment areas in rural Lesotho. METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis. Patients aged >/=16 years were stratified into a HC- and a hospital-group. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLES: Type of backbone at ART-initiation (i), substitutions within first line (ii) and type of backbone among patients retained by December 2010 (iii). A multiple logistic regression model including HC vs. hospital, patient characteristics (sex, age, WHO-stage, baseline CD4-count, concurrent pregnancy, concurrent tuberculosis treatment) and year of ART-start, was used. RESULTS: Of 3936 adult patients initiated on ART between 2007 and 2010, 1971 started at hospitals and 1965 at HCs. Hospitals were more likely to follow the new guidelines as measured by prescription of backbones without stavudine (Odds-ratio 1.55; 95%CI: 1.32-1.81) and had a higher rate of drug substitutions while on first-line ART (2.39; 1.83-3.13). By December 2010, patients followed at health centres were more likely to still receive stavudine (2.28; 1.83-2.84). CONCLUSIONS: Health centers took longer to adopt the new guidelines and substituted drugs less frequently. Decentralised ART-programmes need close support, supervision and mentoring to absorb new guidelines and to adhere to them.</td>

      <td>Could early antiretroviral therapy entail more risks than benefits in sub-Saharan African HIV-infected adults? A model-based analysis.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in all HIV-infected adults, regardless of CD4(+) T-cell count, is a proposed strategy for reducing HIV transmission. We investigated the conditions under which starting ART early could entail more risks than benefits for patients with high CD4(+) T-cell counts. METHODS: We used a simulation model to compare ART initiation upon entry to care ('immediate ART') to initiation at CD4(+) T-cell count </= 350 cells/mul ('WHO 2010 ART') in African adults with CD4(+) T-cell counts >500 cells/mul. We varied inputs to determine the combination of parameters (population characteristics, conditions of care, treatment outcomes) that would result in higher 15-year mortality with immediate ART. RESULTS: The 15-year mortality was 56.7% for WHO 2010 ART and 51.8% for immediate ART. In one-way sensitivity analysis, lower 15-year mortality was consistently achieved with immediate ART unless the rate of fatal ART toxicity was >1.0/100 person-years, the rate of withdrawal from care was >1.2-fold higher or the rate of ART failure due to poor adherence was >4.3-fold higher on immediate than on WHO 2010 ART. In multi-way sensitivity analysis, immediate ART led to higher mortality when moderate rates of fatal ART toxicity (0.25/100 person-years) were combined with rates of withdrawal from care >1.1-fold higher and rates of treatment failure >2.1-fold higher on immediate than on WHO 2010 ART. CONCLUSIONS: In sub-Saharan Africa, ART initiation at entry into care would improve long-term survival of patients with high CD4(+) T-cell counts, unless it is associated with increased withdrawal from care and decreased adherence. In early ART trials, a focus on retention and adherence will be crucial.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: Our objective was to test the hypothesis that treatment for trichomoniasis among HIV-infected women not taking antiretrovirals in South Africa would be associated with decreased HIV genital shedding. METHODS: HIV-infected women presenting for routine HIV care were screened for trichomoniasis using self-collected vaginal swabs with a rapid point-of-care immunochromatographic antigen test. Women testing positive were offered enrollment into a prospective cohort study, if they had documented HIV infection, were aged 18 to 50 years, and were not receiving antiretroviral therapy. Recent use of postexposure prophylaxis or antibiotic therapy, active genital ulcers, or systemic illness were exclusion criteria. Cervical swabs were collected for gonococcal and chlamydial testing, and those testing positive were excluded. Women were treated with directly observed oral therapy with 2 g of oral metronidazole. A follow-up visit was scheduled 1 month after therapy, and partner letters were provided. Paired cervical wicks and plasma were collected for viral load measurement. RESULTS: In all, 557 women were screened. Sixty tested positive for trichomoniasis, 10 subsequently met exclusion criteria, and 4 were lost to follow-up. Of 46 women evaluated at follow-up, 37 (80.4%) were cured. Plasma viral load was not significantly different after therapy (P = 0.93). Genital tract viral load decreased by 0.5 log10 (P < 0.01). The mean genital tract viral load (log10) decreased from 4.66 (<3.52-6.46) to 4.18 (<3.52-6.48) (P < 0.01) after therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Screening and treatment of vaginal trichomoniasis decrease genital shedding of HIV among South African women not receiving antiretrovirals at 1 month after therapy.</td>

      <td>The Tingathe programme: a pilot intervention using community health workers to create a continuum of care in the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) cascade of services in Malawi.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Loss to follow-up is a major challenge in the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programme in Malawi with reported loss to follow-up of greater than 70%. Tingathe-PMTCT is a pilot intervention that utilizes dedicated community health workers (CHWs) to create a complete continuum of care within the PMTCT cascade, improving service utilization and retention of mothers and infants. We describe the impact of the intervention on longitudinal care starting with diagnosis of the mother at antenatal care (ANC) through final diagnosis of the infant. METHODS: PMTCT service utilization, programme retention and outcomes were evaluated for pregnant women living with HIV and their exposed infants enrolled in the Tingathe-PMTCT programme between March 2009 and March 2011. Multivariate logistic regression was done to evaluate maternal factors associated with failure to complete the cascade. RESULTS: Over 24 months, 1688 pregnant women living with HIV were enrolled. Median maternal age was 27 years (IQR, 23.8 to 30.8); 333 (19.7%) were already on ART. Among the remaining women, 1328/1355 (98%) received a CD4 test, with 1243/1328 (93.6%) receiving results. Of the 499 eligible for ART, 363 (72.8%) were successfully initiated. Prior to, delivery there were 93 (5.7%) maternal/foetal deaths, 137 (8.1%) women transferred/moved, 51 (3.0%) were lost and 58 (3.4%) refused ongoing PMTCT services. Of the 1318 live births to date, 1264 (95.9%) of the mothers and 1285 (97.5%) of the infants received ARV prophylaxis; 1064 (80.7%) infants were tested for HIV by PCR and started on cotrimoxazole. Median age at PCR was 1.7 months (IQR, 1.5 to 2.5). Overall transmission at first PCR was 43/1047 (4.1%). Of the 43 infants with positive PCR results, 36 (83.7%) were enrolled in ART clinic and 33 (76.7%) were initiated on ART. CONCLUSIONS: Case management and support by dedicated CHWs can create a continuum of longitudinal care in the PMTCT cascade and result in improved outcomes.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: To assess awareness of and interest in intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) use among HIV-positive women in Cape Town, South Africa. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: HIV-positive women aged 18 through 45 years presenting for care at a primary health care clinic in Cape Town, South Africa participated in this study. Consented participants completed a staff-administered questionnaire in a private setting. Descriptive statistics were generated. Comparisons between demographic and reproductive health-related variables and IUCD awareness and interest were performed with multiple logistic regression. Analyses for IUCD interest excluded women with prior surgical sterilization. RESULTS: Of 277 HIV-positive women, 37% were aware of the IUCD; awareness was independently associated with greater age (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=1.15, 95%; confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.20) and not switching contraceptive methods in the last year (AOR=2.45, 95% CI: 1.03-5.83). Following an IUCD information session, 86% of women (n=206/240) were interested in IUCD use. IUCD interest was inversely associated with age (AOR=0.91, 95% CI: 0.86-0.97) and marginally positively associated with current menstrual bleeding pattern complaints (AOR=2.14, 95% CI: 0.98-4.68). CONCLUSIONS: Despite low levels of method awareness, HIV-positive women in this setting are frequently interested in IUCD use, indicating need for programming to expand method access.</td>

      <td>Rethinking the "pre" in pre-therapy counseling: no benefit of additional visits prior to therapy on adherence or viremia in Ugandans initiating ARVs.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Many guidelines recommend adherence counseling prior to initiating antiretrovirals (ARVs), however the additional benefit of pre-therapy counseling visits on early adherence is not known. We sought to assess for a benefit of adherence counseling visits prior to ARV initiation versus adherence counseling during the early treatment period. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of data from a prospective cohort of HIV-infected patients in Mbarara, Uganda. Adults were enrolled upon initiation of ARVs. Our primary exposure of interest was ARV adherence counseling prior to initiating therapy (versus concurrent with initiation of therapy). Our outcomes of interest were: 1) average adherence >90% in first three months; 2) absence of treatment interruptions >72 hours in first three months; and 3) Viral load >400 copies/ml at the three month visit. We fit univariable and multivariable regression models, adjusted for predictors of ARV adherence, to estimate the association between additional pre-therapy counseling visits and our outcomes. RESULTS: 300 participants had records of counseling, of whom 231 (77%) completed visits prior to initiation of ARVs and 69 (23%) on or shortly after initiation. Median age was 33, 71% were female, and median CD4 was 133 cell/ml. Median 90-day adherence was 95%. Participants who completed pre-therapy counseling visits had longer delays from ARV eligibility to initiation (median 49 vs 14 days, p<0.01). In multivariable analyses, completing adherence counseling prior to ARV initiation was not associated with average adherence >90% (AOR 0.8, 95%CI 0.4-1.5), absence of treatment gaps (AOR 0.7, 95%CI 0.2-1.9), or HIV viremia (AOR 1.1, 95%CI 0.4-3.1). CONCLUSIONS: Completion of adherence counseling visits prior to ARV therapy was not associated with higher adherence in this cohort of HIV-infected patients in Uganda. Because mortality and loss-to-follow-up remain high in the pre-ARV period, policy makers should reconsider whether counseling can be delivered with ARV initiation, especially in patients with advanced disease.</td>

      <td>The make or buy debate: considering the limitations of domestic production in Tanzania.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In order to ensure their population's regular access to essential medicines, many least developed countries and developing countries are faced with the policy question of whether to import or manufacture drugs locally, in particular for life-saving antiretroviral medicines for HIV/AIDS patients. In order for domestic manufacturing to be viable and cost-effective, the local industry must be able to compete with international suppliers of medicines by producing sufficiently low cost ARVs. METHODS: This paper considers the 'make-or-buy' dilemma by using Tanzania as a case study. Key informant interviews, event-driven observation, and purposive sampling of documents were used to evaluate the case study. The case study focused on Tanzania's imitation technology transfer agreement to locally manufacture a first-line ARV (3TC + d4T + NVP), reverse engineering the ARV. RESULTS: Tanzania is limited by weak political support for the use of TRIPS flexibilities, limited production capacity for ARVs and limited competitiveness in both domestic and regional markets. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare encourages the use of flexibilities while others push for increased IP protection. Insufficient production capacity and lack of access to donor-financed tenders make it difficult to obtain economies of scale and provide competitive prices. CONCLUSIONS: Within the "make-or-buy" context, it was determined that there are significant limitations in domestic manufacturing for developing countries. The case study highlights the difficulty of governments to make use of economies of scale and produce low-cost medicines, attract technology transfer, and utilize the flexibilities of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The results demonstrate the importance of evaluating barriers to the use of TRIPS flexibilities and long-term planning across sectors in future technology transfer and manufacturing initiatives.</td>

      <td>A case-control study of factors associated with non-adherent to antiretroviral therapy among HIV infected people in Pwani Region, eastern Tanzania.</td>
      <td>Non-adherence is one of the major causes of treatment failure which leads to increased morbidity and mortality caused by opportunistic infections. Optimal anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence is essential for maximal suppression of viral replication and long term survival of patients. In order to develop effective public health interventions in the context of scaling ART services to peripheral areas, it is important to evaluate factors associated with non-adherence among HIV-infected individuals in Pwani Region. The purpose of this study was to identify factors related to non-adherence to ART among HIV infected people in Pwani Region eastern of Tanzania. A case-control study was carried out at Tumbi Hospital and Chalinze Health Centre in Pwani Region in eastern Tanzania. A structured questionnaire was used to assess non-adherence and adherence to doses instruction and time schedule. Patients with less than 95% adherence were defined as cases while those with more than 95% adherence became controls. A structured questionnaire containing factors known to be associated with non-adherence to ART in similar settings was administered. Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with non-adherence. A total of 79 cases and 237 controls matched by age and sex were studied. A high proportion of cases and controls (77.2% and 84.8%) had good knowledge ofART benefits, adherence and eligibility. Majority of cases (73.3%) and controls (69.2%) used public transport to access ART services. More than half of cases (53.2%) missed clinic appointments due to lack of bus fare or other reasons and was associated with ART non adherence (mOR 4.2, 95%CI, 2.2-8.1 and 2.1,95%CI 1.2-4.2). Disclosure to confidants only and failure to disclose HIV-test positive status were associated with non adherence (mOR 3.3, 95%CI 1.3-8.5 and 2.3, 95%CI 1.2-7.1). Alcohol use was associated with non adherence to ART (mOR 1.9, 95%CI 1.4-3.7). Patients who were not satisfied with providers were more likely to be non adherence to ART (mOR 2.0, 95%CI 1.2-3.8). In conclusion, these findings show that adherence is a process which is depended on local specific adherence factors. Adherence improvement strategies need to consider site specific adherence determinants, patient experiences and concerns.</td>

      <td>Effect of baseline immune suppression on growth recovery in HIV positive South African children receiving antiretroviral treatment.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Growth failure is common among children infected with HIV. The degree of growth recovery and its determinants in children initiating combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) are not well understood. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of children who initiated cART between 2004 and 2008 at a pediatric HIV clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa. To determine the effect of severe immunodeficiency at cART initiation on growth recovery (defined as attaining a z-score > -2), we generated Kaplan-Meier survival functions and fit a Cox proportional hazards model. In sensitivity analyses, we assessed selection bias due to loss to follow-up or death. RESULTS: Of the 2399 children who initiated cART, 71% presented with growth failure. Within 2 years of cART, only 81% of underweight children achieved normal weight, and 64% of stunted children achieved length/height recovery. Severe immunodeficiency at cART initiation was not associated with weight recovery [hazards ratio: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.32] or length/height recovery (hazards ratio: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.34) in overall analyses, and modification by baseline growth failure and age were modest. Older children and those with severe growth failure were less likely to achieve growth recovery, regardless of baseline immunodeficiency status. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of children fail to achieve growth recovery despite 2 years of cART. Our analysis did not support an association between baseline immunodeficiency and growth recovery. Younger age and less-severe growth failure at cART initiation are strong predictors of achieving growth recovery. These findings support early initiation of cART, before the presence of growth failure, and independent of level of immunodeficiency.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVES: To assess outcomes over the first 7 years of antiretroviral therapy (ART) at Themba Lethu Clinic, Johannesburg, South Africa. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. METHODS: Patients are managed according to South African National Treatment Guidelines. Mortality is ascertained through linkage with the national vital registration system. Loss to follow-up is defined as at least 3 months late for the last scheduled appointment. RESULTS: Between April 2004 and March 2010, 13 227 patients initiated ART, increasing from 1794 in the year 2004/2005 to 2481 in 2009/2010. Median CD4 cell count at ART initiation increased 39% between 2004 and 2009 (82 vs. 114 cells/ml). The proportion who died within 1 year on ART was below 11% at all time points, whereas the proportion lost by 1 year increased from 8.5% in 2004 to 12.1% in 2009 [risk ratio (RR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.71]. We followed the 1794 patients initiated in April 2004 and March 2005 through August 2011 for 8172 person-years. We estimated 25% of patients were lost and 16% died. The overall mortality rate was 3.59 per 100 person-years (95% CI 3.20-4.02). Of the 1577 who completed at least 6 months of follow-up, 213 (13.5%) failed first-line treatment in a median (interquartile range) of 25.9 (15.8-41.4) months on treatment. Of those who failed, 141 (66.2%) switched to second-line for a rate of 48.5 per 100 person-years (95% CI 41.1-57.2). CONCLUSION: Despite some improvements over 7 years, more intervention is needed in the first year on treatment to reduce overall attrition.</td>

      <td>High rate of K65R for antiretroviral therapy-naive patients with subtype C HIV infection failing a tenofovir-containing first-line regimen.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the rate of the K65R mutation in patients receiving tenofovir (TDF)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) with subtype C HIV infection. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: All patients initiated on stavudine (d4T) with lamivudine (3TC) or TDF with 3TC and a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor at McCord Hospital in Durban, South Africa had their charts reviewed. All patients with virologic failure, defined as a viral load more than 1000 copies/ml after 5 months of a first ART regimen, had genotypic resistance testing performed prospectively using a validated in-house assay. Important resistance mutations were selected based upon published mutations in subtype B virus in the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance database. RESULTS: A total of 585 patients were initiated on TDF-containing first-line ART from 3 August 2010 to 17 March 2011. Thirty-five (6.0%) of these patients had virologic failure and 23 of 33 (69.7%) of the virologic failure patients had the K65R mutation. The median (interquartile range) for the baseline CD4 cell count was 105 cells/mul (49-209) and viral load at virologic failure was 47 571 copies/ml (20 708-202 000). During the same period, 53 patients were initiated on d4T-containing regimens. Two (3.8%) of these patients had virologic failure and one of the virologic failure patients had the K65R mutation. CONCLUSION: Preliminary data show very high rates (>65%) of K65R for patients failing TDF-based first-line regimens at McCord Hospital with few additional nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations compared with subtype B. These rates may reflect faster in-vivo selection, longer time on a failing regimen or transmitted drug resistance.</td>

      <td>Rifampicin for continuation phase tuberculosis treatment in Uganda: a cost-effectiveness analysis.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In Uganda, isoniazid plus ethambutol is used for 6 months (6HE) during the continuation treatment phase of new tuberculosis (TB) cases. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using isoniazid plus rifampicin for 4 months (4HR) instead of 6HE. We compared the impact of a continuation phase using 6HE or 4HR on total cost and expected mortality from the perspective of the Ugandan national health system. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Treatment costs and outcomes were determined by decision analysis. Median daily drug price was US$0.115 for HR and US$0.069 for HE. TB treatment failure or relapse and mortality rates associated with 6HE vs. 4HR were obtained from randomized trials and systematic reviews for HIV-negative (46% of TB cases; failure/relapse -6HE: 10.4% vs. 4HR: 5.2%; mortality -6HE: 5.6% vs. 4HR: 3.5%) and HIV-positive patients (54% of TB cases; failure or relapse -6HE: 13.7% vs. 4HR: 12.4%; mortality -6HE: 16.6% vs. 4HR: 10.5%). When the initial treatment is not successful, retreatment involves an additional 8-month drug-regimen at a cost of $110.70. The model predicted a mortality rate of 13.3% for patients treated with 6HE and 8.8% for 4HR; average treatment cost per patient was predicted at $26.07 for 6HE and $23.64 for 4HR. These results were robust to the inclusion of MDR-TB as an additional outcome after treatment failure or relapse. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Combination therapy with 4HR in the continuation phase dominates 6HE as it is associated with both lower expected costs and lower expected mortality. These data support the WHO recommendation to transition to a continuation phase comprising 4HR.</td>

      <td>Nevirapine- versus lopinavir/ritonavir-based initial therapy for HIV-1 infection among women in Africa: a randomized trial.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Nevirapine (NVP) is widely used in antiretroviral treatment (ART) of HIV-1 globally. The primary objective of the AA5208/OCTANE trial was to compare the efficacy of NVP-based versus lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based initial ART. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In seven African countries (Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe), 500 antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected women with CD4<200 cells/mm(3) were enrolled into a two-arm randomized trial to initiate open-label ART with tenofovir (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC) once/day plus either NVP (n = 249) or LPV/r (n = 251) twice/day, and followed for >/=48 weeks. The primary endpoint was time from randomization to death or confirmed virologic failure ([VF]) (plasma HIV RNA<1 log(10) below baseline 12 weeks after treatment initiation, or >/=400 copies/ml at or after 24 weeks), with comparison between treatments based on hazard ratios (HRs) in intention-to-treat analysis. Equivalence of randomized treatments was defined as finding the 95% CI for HR for virological failure or death in the range 0.5 to 2.0. Baseline characteristics were (median): age = 34 years, CD4 = 121 cells/mm(3), HIV RNA = 5.2 log(10)copies/ml. Median follow-up = 118 weeks; 29 (6%) women were lost to follow-up. 42 women (37 VFs, five deaths; 17%) in the NVP and 50 (43 VFs, seven deaths; 20%) in the LPV/r arm reached the primary endpoint (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.56-1.29). During initial assigned treatment, 14% and 16% of women receiving NVP and LPV/r experienced grade 3/4 signs/symptoms and 26% and 22% experienced grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities. However, 35 (14%) women discontinued NVP because of adverse events, most in the first 8 weeks, versus none for LPV/r (p<0.001). VF, death, or permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 80 (32%) of NVP and 54 (22%) of LPV/r arms (HR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.4), with the difference primarily due to more treatment discontinuation in the NVP arm. 13 (45%) of 29 women tested in the NVP versus six (15%) of 40 in the LPV/r arm had any drug resistance mutation at time of VF. CONCLUSIONS: Initial ART with NVP+TDF/FTC demonstrated equivalent virologic efficacy but higher rates of treatment discontinuation and new drug resistance compared with LPV/r+TDF/FTC in antiretroviral-naive women with CD4<200 cells/mm(3).

      <td>Preventing HIV by providing support for orphan girls to stay in school: does religion matter?</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: The paper examines the influence of religion on attitudes, behaviors, and HIV infection among rural adolescent women in Zimbabwe. DESIGN: We analyzed data from a 2007 to 2010 randomized controlled trial in rural eastern Zimbabwe testing whether school support can prevent HIV risk behaviors and related attitudes among rural adolescent orphan girls; supplementary data from the 2006 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) were also analyzed. The present study design is largely cross-sectional, using the most recent available survey data from the clinical trial to examine the association between religious affiliation and religiosity on school dropout, marriage, and related attitudes, controlling for intervention condition, age and orphan type. The ZDHS data examined the effect of religious denomination on marriage and HIV status among young rural women, controlling for age. RESULTS: Apostolic Church affiliation greatly increased the likelihood of early marriage compared to reference Methodist Church affiliation (odds ratio = 4.5). Greater religiosity independently reduced the likelihood of school dropout, increased gender equity attitudes and disagreement with early sex, and marginally reduced early marriage. Young rural Apostolic women in the ZDHS were nearly four times as likely to marry as teenagers compared to Protestants, and marriage doubled the likelihood of HIV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Findings contradict an earlier seminal study that Apostolics are relatively protected from HIV compared to other Christian denominations. Young Apostolic women are at increased risk of HIV infection through early marriage. The Apostolic Church is a large and growing denomination in sub-Saharan Africa and many Apostolic sects discourage medical testing and treatment in favor of faith healing. Since this can increase the risk of undiagnosed HIV infection for young married women and their infants in high prevalence areas, further study is urgently needed to confirm this emerging public health problem, particularly among orphan girls. Although empirical evidence suggests that keeping orphan girls in school can reduce HIV risk factors, further study of the religious context and the implications for prevention are needed.</td>

      <td>Community adherence support improves programme retention in children on antiretroviral treatment: a multicentre cohort study in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: HIV-positive children in low-income settings face many challenges to adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) and have increased mortality on treatment compared to children in developed countries. Adult ART programmes have demonstrated benefit from community support to improve treatment outcomes; however, there are no empirical data on the effectiveness of this intervention in children. This study compared clinical, virological and immunological outcomes between children who received and who did not receive community-based adherence support from patient advocates (PAs) in four South African provinces. METHODS: A multicentre cohort study of ART-naive children was conducted at 47 public ART facilities. Outcome measures were mortality, patient retention, virological suppression and CD4 percentage changes on ART. PAs are lay community health workers who provide adherence and psychosocial support for children's caregivers, and they undertake home visits to ascertain household challenges potentially impacting on adherence in the child. Corrected mortality estimates were calculated, correcting for deaths amongst those lost to follow-up (LTFU) using probability-weighted Kaplan-Meier and Cox functions. RESULTS: Three thousand five hundred and sixty three children were included with a median baseline age of 6.3 years and a median baseline CD4 cell percentage of 12.0%. PA-supported children numbered 323 (9.1%). Baseline clinical status variables were equivalent between the two groups. Amongst children LTFU, 38.7% were known to have died. Patient retention after 3 years of ART was 91.5% (95% CI: 86.8% to 94.7%) vs. 85.6% (95% CI: 83.3% to 87.6%) amongst children with and without PAs, respectively (p = 0.027). Amongst children aged below 2 years at baseline, retention after 3 years was 92.2% (95% CI: 76.7% to 97.6%) vs. 74.2% (95% CI: 65.4% to 81.0%) in children with and without PAs, respectively (p = 0.053). Corrected mortality after 3 years of ART was 3.7% (95% CI: 1.9% to 7.4%) vs. 8.0% (95% CI: 6.5% to 9.8%) amongst children with and without PAs, respectively (p = 0.060). In multivariable analyses, children with PAs had reduced probabilities of both attrition and mortality, adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 0.57 (95% CI: 0.35 to 0.94) and 0.39 (95% CI: 0.15 to 1.04), respectively. CONCLUSION: Community-based adherence support is an effective way to improve patient retention amongst children on ART. Expanded implementation of this intervention should be considered in order to reach ART programmatic goals in low-income settings as more children access treatment.</td>

      <td>Cost-effectiveness of laboratory monitoring for management of HIV treatment in sub-Saharan Africa: a model-based analysis.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of three different strategies for long-term monitoring of antiretroviral therapy (ART) failure and regimen switching in sub-Saharan Africa: a symptom-based approach, or monitoring of either CD4 cell counts or plasma viral load (pVL). DESIGN: Markov model. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical HIV-infected adult population who began first-line ART and subsequently had up to 6 years of follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total cost, life expectancy and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: A symptom-based approach yielded a life expectancy of 64.0 months at a total cost of US$ 4028 per person. All laboratory-based strategies, at testing intervals of 6 or 12 months, were cost-saving and improved life expectancy, compared with a symptom-based approach. The life-expectancy gain was larger for pVL than for CD4 strategies at 6-monthly (2.3 and 0.9 months, respectively) and 12-monthly testing (2.0 and 0.8 months, respectively). Cost-savings of 6-monthly pVL or CD4 testing were similar (US$ 630 and 621, respectively), whereas 12-monthly CD4 cell counts were more cost-saving than 12-monthly pVL (US$ 1132 and 880, respectively). Testing every 12 months - rather than every 6 months - decreased the ICER by 102% for CD4 cell count and 67% for pVL. These findings were robust to a wide range of deterministic sensitivity analyses, but were sensitive to the specificity and costs of diagnostic tests. CONCLUSION: Additional diagnostic costs are balanced by cost-savings from avoiding unnecessary switching due to misdiagnosis of ART failure. Routine pVL monitoring may be preferred as a replacement for CD4 cell counts because of its additional public-health advantages in preventing drug-resistance, supporting adherence and reducing HIV transmission.</td>

      <td>Treatment failure among Kenyan children with severe pneumonia--a cohort study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is the leading cause of childhood mortality worldwide. The World Health Organization recommends presumptive treatment based on clinical syndromes. Recent studies raise concerns over the frequency of treatment failure in Africa. METHODS: We applied a definition of treatment failure to data prospectively collected from children who were 2-59 months of age with severe, or very severe, pneumonia admitted to Kilifi District Hospital, Kenya, from May 2007 through May 2008 and treated using World Health Organization guidelines. The primary outcome was treatment failure at 48 hours. RESULTS: Of 568 children, median age 11 months, 165 (29%) had very severe pneumonia, 30 (5.3%) a positive HIV test and 62 (11%) severe malnutrition. One hundred eleven (20%; 95% confidence interval: 17-23%) children failed treatment at 48 hours and 34 (6.0%) died; 22 (65%) deaths occurred before 48 hours. Of 353 children with severe pneumonia, without HIV or severe malnutrition, 42 (12%) failed to respond at 48 hours, 15 (4.3%) failed at 5 days and 1 child (0.3%) died. Among 215 children with either severe pneumonia complicated by HIV or severe malnutrition, or very severe pneumonia, 69 (32%) failed to treatment at 48 hours, 47 (22%) failed at 5 days and 33 (16%) died. Treatment failure at 48 hours was associated with shock, bacteremia, very severe pneumonia, oxygen saturation in hemoglobin <95%, severe malnutrition, HIV and age <1 year in multivariable models. CONCLUSIONS: In this setting, few children with uncomplicated severe pneumonia fail treatment or die under current guidelines. Deaths mainly occurred early and may be reduced by improving prevention, prehospital care and treatment of sepsis.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: To compare access to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care for tuberculosis (TB) patients in settings with antiretroviral treatment (ART) and TB care under one roof ('semi-integrated sites') and in settings with geographically separately rendered care in Tshwane, South Africa. METHODS: Historical cohort study of patients registered with TB at 46 TB treatment points, with follow-up until the end of anti-tuberculosis treatment. ART initiation for HIV-positive TB patients was established through linkage of TB register patient identifiers to the electronic ART register. Data analysis entailed univariate and multivariate competing risk analysis. RESULTS: The records of 636 and 1297 patients for semi-integrated and separate facilities, respectively, were reviewed. Cotrimoxazole prophylactic therapy and recording of CD4 count were lower in semi-integrated than in separate facilities, but the reverse was true for referral to HIV-related care. A higher percentage of patients started ART in the semi-integrated than in the separate facilities (70.5% vs. 44.6%, P < 0.001). In competing risk analysis (with death and lost to follow-up as competing risks), attending a semi-integrated facility (sub-hazard ratio [SHR] 2.49, 95%CI 1.06-5.88) and TB case load > 401 (SHR 1.45, 95%CI 1.04-2.03) were associated with increased ART initiation. CONCLUSIONS: ART and TB treatment under one roof appears to facilitate ART initiation for HIV-positive TB patients.</td>

The primary and secondary endpoints were respectively 24-week mortality and 24-week virologic suppression. Multivariable logistic regression modeling explored the associations between baseline (i.e., pre-hospital discharge) characteristics and mortality at 24 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 382 patients were prospectively enrolled (48% women, median age 37 years, median CD4 count 33 cells/mm(3)). Acute OIs were pulmonary TB, 39%; extra-pulmonary TB, 25%; cryptococcal meningitis (CM), 10%; and chronic diarrhea, 9%. The median time from admission to ART initiation was 14 days (range 4-32, IQR 11-18). At 24 weeks of follow-up, as-treated and intention-to-treat virologic suppression were respectively 57% and 93%. Median change in CD4 cell count was +100 cells/mm(3), overall 24-week mortality was 25% and loss to follow-up, 5%. Excess mortality was not observed among patients with CM who initiated early ART. A longer interval between admission and ART was associated with mortality (>21 days vs. <21 days after admission OR 2.1, 95%CI 1.2-4.0, P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: For HIV-infected in-patients with TB or an acquired immune-deficiency syndrome defining OI, we demonstrate the operational feasibility of early ART initiation in in-patients.</td>

      <td>Association of adherence support and outreach services with total attrition, loss to follow-up, and death among ART patients in sub-Saharan Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Loss to follow-up (LTF) after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation is common in HIV clinics. We examined the effect of availability of adherence support and active patient outreach services on patient attrition following ART initiation. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This ecologic study examined clinic attrition rates (total attrition, LTF, and death) among 232,389 patients initiating ART at 349 clinics during 2004-2008 in 10 sub-Saharan African countries, and cohort attrition (proportion retained at 6 and 12 months after ART initiation) among a subset of patients with follow-up information (n=83,389). Log-linear regression compared mean rates of attrition, LTF, and death between clinics with and without adherence support and outreach services. Cumulative attrition, LTF, and death rates were 14.2, 9.2, and 4.9 per 100 person-years on ART, respectively. In multivariate analyses, clinic availability of >2 adherence support services was marginally associated with lower attrition rates (RR(adj)=0.59, 95%CI: 0.35-1.0). Clinics with availability of counseling services (RR(adj)=0.62, 95%CI: 0.42-0.92), educational materials (RR(adj)=0.73, 95%CI: 0.63-0.85), reminder tools (RR(adj)=0.79, 95%CI: 0.64-0.97), and food rations (RR(adj)=0.72, 95%CI: 0.58-0.90) had significantly lower attrition, with similar results observed for LTF. Outreach services were not significantly associated with attrition. In cohort analyses, attrition was significantly lower at clinics offering >2 adherence support services (RR(adj,6m)=0.84, 95%CI: 0.73-0.96), dedicated pharmacy services (RR(adj,6m)=0.78, 95%CI: 0.69-0.90), and active patient outreach (RR(adj,6m)=0.85, 95%CI: 0.73-0.99). Availability of food rations was marginally associated with increased retention at 6 (RR(adj,6m) =0.82, 95%CI: 0.64-1.05) but not 12 months (RR(adj,12m) =0.98, 95%CI: 0.78-1.21). CONCLUSIONS: Availability of adherence support services, active patient outreach and food rations at HIV care clinics may improve retention following ART initiation.</td>

      <td>Evaluating the competing risks of HIV acquisition and maternal mortality in Africa: a decision analysis.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To model the risk of HIV acquisition and maternal mortality for women in four African countries in the light of previous data on risk of HIV acquisition and hormonal contraceptive use. DESIGN: Decision analysis. SETTING: Chad, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda. POPULATION: Women of reproductive age, at risk of HIV, who do not desire pregnancy. METHODS: A decision analysis model was built to compare the consequences of removing progestin injectables from use, assuming an increased risk of HIV acquisition. Three scenarios were considered in four African countries: replacement of progestin injectables with no method, with combined oral contraceptives (COC) or with an intrauterine device (IUD). Health outcomes measured include: life-years, maternal mortality, HIV acquisition and unsafe abortion. Sensitivity analysis, including Monte Carlo simulation, was performed around all variables. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HIV acquisition, maternal mortality and life-years. RESULTS: If progestin injectables are removed from use, without a minimum of 70-100% of women switching to an IUD or COCs, up to nine additional maternal deaths will occur for every case of HIV averted. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that this finding persisted across a broad range of variables. CONCLUSIONS: Contraception is critical to preserving life for women in Africa. In the absence of clear evidence regarding hormonal contraception and HIV acquisition, policy decisions must not overlook the very real risk of maternal mortality.</td>

      <td>Use of service data to inform pediatric HIV-free survival following prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs in rural Malawi.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Recent years have seen rapid and significant progress in science and implementation of programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Programs that support PMTCT routinely monitor service provision but very few have measured their effectiveness. The objective of the study was to use service data to inform HIV-free survival among HIV exposed children that received antiretroviral drugs to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV. The study was conducted in two rural districts in Malawi with support from FHI 360. METHODS: A descriptive observational study of PMTCT outcomes was conducted between June 2005 and June 2009. The dataset included patient-level data of all pregnant women 1) that tested HIV-positive, 2) that were dispensed with antiretroviral prophylaxis, and 3) whose addresses were available for home visits. The data were matched to each woman's corresponding antenatal clinic data from home visit registers. RESULTS: Out of 438 children whose home addresses were available, 33 (8%) were lost to follow-up, 35 (8%) were alive but not tested for HIV by the time home visit was conducted, and 52 (12%) were confirmed deceased. A total of 318 children were alive at the time of the home visit and had an HIV antibody test done at median age 15 months. The resulting estimated 24-month probability of HIV-free survival over all children was 78%. Among children who did not receive nevirapine, the estimated 24-month probability of HIV-free survival was 61%, and among those who did receive NVP syrup the estimate was 82%. CONCLUSIONS: When mothers and newborns received nevirapine, the estimated 24-month probability of HIV-free survival among children was high at 82% (CI: 54% to 99%). However this conclusion should be interpreted cautiously 1) due to the wide confidence interval; and 2) because the confidence interval range includes 55%, which is the natural HIV-free survival rate in the absence of a PMTCT intervention. This analysis highlighted the need of quality data and well-structured home visits to assess PMTCT effectiveness.</td>

      <td>Increased risk of mortality and loss to follow-up among HIV-positive patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis and malnutrition before antiretroviral therapy initiation: a retrospective analysis from a large urban cohort in Johannesburg, South Africa.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OC) and body mass index (BMI) before antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation on treatment outcomes of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. STUDY DESIGN: Treatment outcomes included failure to increase CD4 count by >/=50 or >/=100 cells/muL or failure to suppress viral load (<400 copies/mL) at 6 or 12 months in addition to loss to follow-up (LTFU) and mortality by 12 months. Risk and hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with the use of log-binomial regression and Cox proportional hazards models, respectively. RESULTS: Baseline CD4 <100 cells/muL, low BMI (<18.5 kg/m(2)), low hemoglobin, and elevated aspartate transaminase were associated with OC at ART initiation. Patients with low BMI with and without, respectively, OC were at risk of mortality (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.88-3.12; HR 1.87, 95% CI 1.54-2.28) and LTFU (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.02-1.82; HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.30-1.85). CONCLUSIONS: Low BMI (with/without OC) at ART initiation was associated with poor treatment outcomes. Conversely, normal BMI with OC was associated with adequate CD4 response and reduced LTFU compared with without OC.</td>

      <td>Burden of antituberculosis and antiretroviral drug-induced liver injury at a secondary hospital in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: G F Jooste Hospital (GFJH) is a secondary-level referral hospital in a high HIV and tuberculosis (TB) co-infection setting. AIMS: To assess the proportion of significant drug-induced liver injury (DILI) due to tuberculosis treatment (TBT) and/or antiretroviral therapy (ART) among patients presenting with liver dysfunction at GFJH and to describe management and outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed of all cases referred to GFJH with significant liver dysfunction from 1 January to 30 June 2009. Significant liver dysfunction was defined by alanine transaminase (ALT)>/=200 U/l or total bilirubin (TBR)>/=44 micromol/l. TBT- or ART-associated DILI was defined as significant liver dysfunction attributed to TBT and/or ART and which resulted in the halting of treatment or the adjustment thereof. Outcome measures included case numbers, descriptive data, and in-hospital and 3-month mortality. RESULTS: A total of 318/354 cases of significant liver dysfunction were reviewed: 71 were classified as TBT- or ART-associated DILI, while liver dysfunction was attributed to other causes in the remainder. In-hospital and 3-month mortality of TBT- or ART-associated DILI patients was 27% (n=19) and 35% (n=25), respectively. The majority of deaths were related to sepsis or sepsis complicating liver dysfunction. Twenty-three patients (32%) were lost to follow-up; 23 (32%) were alive and in outpatient care 3 months after presentation. CONCLUSIONS: TBT- or ART-associated DILI is a common reason for presentation at a referral hospital in South Africa. In-hospital and 3-month mortality are high. Prospective studies are needed to define optimal management.</td>

      <td>Improved neuropsychological and neurological functioning across three antiretroviral regimens in diverse resource-limited settings: AIDS Clinical Trials Group study a5199, the International Neurological Study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) A5199 compared the neurological and neuropsychological (NP) effects of 3 antiretroviral regimens in participants infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in resource-limited settings. METHODS: Participants from Brazil, India, Malawi, Peru, South Africa, Thailand, and Zimbabwe were randomized to 3 antiretroviral treatment arms: A (lamivudine-zidovudine plus efavirenz, n = 289), B (atazanavir, emtricitabine, and didanosine-EC, n = 293), and C (emtricitabine-tenofovir-disoproxil fumarate plus efavirenz, n = 278) as part of the ACTG PEARLS study (A5175). Standardized neurological and neuropsychological (NP) screening examinations (grooved pegboard, timed gait, semantic verbal fluency, and finger tapping) were administered every 24 weeks from February 2006 to May 2010. Associations with neurological and neuropsychological function were estimated from linear and logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: The median weeks on study was 168 (Q1 = 96, Q3 = 192) for the 860 participants. NP test scores improved (P < .05) with the exception of semantic verbal fluency. No differences in neurological and neuropsychological functioning between treatment regimens were detected (P > .10). Significant country effects were noted on all NP tests and neurological outcomes (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The study detected no significant differences in neuropsychological and neurological outcomes between randomized ART regimens. Significant improvement occurred in neurocognitive and neurological functioning over time after initiation of ARTs. The etiology of these improvements is likely multifactorial, reflecting reduced central nervous system HIV infection, better general health, and practice effects. This study suggests that treatment with either of the World Health Organization -recommended first-line antiretroviral regimens in resource-limited settings will improve neuropsychological functioning and reduce neurological dysfunction.

      <td>Outcomes of comprehensive care for children empirically treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in a setting of high HIV prevalence.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined outcomes for children treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), including those receiving concomitant treatment for MDR-TB and HIV co-infection. In Lesotho, where the adult HIV seroprevalence is estimated to be 24%, we sought to measure outcomes and adverse events in a cohort of children treated for MDR-TB using a community-based treatment delivery model. METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively the clinical charts of children </=15 years of age treated for culture-confirmed or suspected MDR-TB between July 2007 and January 2011. RESULTS: Nineteen children, ages two to 15, received treatment. At baseline, 74% of patients were co-infected with HIV, 63% were malnourished, 84% had severe radiographic findings, and 21% had extrapulmonary disease. Five (26%) children had culture-confirmed MDR-TB, ten (53%) did not have culture results available, and four (21%) subsequently had results indicating drug-susceptible TB. All children with HIV co-infection who were not already on antiretroviral therapy (ART) were initiated on ART a median of two weeks after the start of the MDR-TB regimen. Among the 17 patients with final outcomes, 15 (88%) patients were cured or completed treatment, two (12%) patients died, and none defaulted or were lost to follow-up. The majority of patients (95%) experienced adverse events; only two required permanent discontinuation of the offending agent, and only one required suspension of MDR-TB treatment for more than one week. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric MDR-TB and MDR-TB/HIV co-infection can be successfully treated using a combination of social support, close monitoring by community health workers and clinicians, and inpatient care when needed. In this cohort, adverse events were well tolerated and treatment outcomes were comparable to those reported in children with drug-susceptible TB and no HIV infection.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVES: To understand reasons for lost-to-follow-up (LTFU) from a community-based antiretroviral therapy program in Uganda. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort of patients LTFU between May 31, 2001, to May 31, 2010, was examined. A representative sample of 579 patients traced to ascertain their outcomes. METHODS: Mixed methods were used. Using "stopped care" as the hazard and "self-transferred" as the comparator, we examined using Cox proportional multivariable model risk factors for stopping care. RESULTS: Overall, 2933 of 3954 (74.0%) patients were LTFU. Of 579 of 2933 (19%) patients sampled for tracing, 32 (5.5%) were untraceable, 66(11.4 %) were dead, and 481 (83.0%) found alive. Of those found alive, 232 (40.0%) stopped care, 249 (43.0%) self-transferred, whereas 61 (12.7%) returned to care at Reach Out Mbuya HIV/AIDS Initiative. In adjusted hazards ratios, born-again religion, originating from outside Kampala, resident in Kampala for <5 years but >1 year, having school-age children who were out of school, non-HIV disclosure, CD4 counts >250 cells per cubic millimeter and pre-antiretroviral therapy were associated with increased risk of stopping care. Qualitative interviews revealed return to a normal life as a key reason for LTFU. Of 61 patients who returned to care, their median CD4 count at LTFU was higher than on return into care (401/mm(3) vs. 205/mm(3), P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Many patients become LTFU during the course of years, necessitating the need for effective mechanisms to identify those in need of close monitoring. Efforts should be made to improve referrals and mechanisms to track patients who transfer to different facilities. Additionally, tracing of patients who become LTFU is required to convince them to return.</td>

      <td>Frequent emergence of N348I in HIV-1 subtype C reverse transcriptase with failure of initial therapy reduces susceptibility to reverse-transcriptase inhibitors.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: It is not known how often mutations in the connection and ribonuclease H domains of reverse transcriptase (RT) emerge with failure of first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in subtype C human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and how these mutations affect susceptibility to other antiretrovirals. METHODS: We compared full-length RT sequences in plasma obtained before therapy and at virologic failure of initial ART among 63 participants with subtype C HIV-1 infection enrolled in the Comprehensive International Program of Research on AIDS in South Africa (CIPRA-SA) study. Recombinant viruses containing full-length plasma-derived RT sequences from participants with N348I at virologic failure were assayed for drug susceptibility. RESULTS: Y181C and M184V mutations in the RT polymerase domain were associated with failure of stavudine-lamivudine-nevirapine (d4T/3TC/NVP; P < .01), and K103N, V106M, and M184V with failure of d4T/3TC/efavirenz (EFV; P < .01). N348I in the RT connection domain emerged in 45% (P = .002) and 12% (P = .06) of participants receiving failing regimens containing NVP or EFV, respectively. Longitudinal analyses revealed that nonnucleoside RT inhibitor resistance mutations in the polymerase domain generally appeared first. N348I emerged at the same time, or after, M184V. N348I in the context of polymerase domain mutations reduced susceptibility to NVP (8.9-13-fold), EFV (4-56-fold), etravirine (ETV; 1.9-4.7-fold) and decreased hypersusceptibility to zidovudine (AZT; 1.4-2.2-fold). CONCLUSIONS: N348I emerges frequently with virologic failure of first-line ART in subtype C HIV-1 infection and reduces susceptibility to NVP, EFV, ETV, and AZT. Additional studies are warranted to characterize the effects of N348I on virologic response to second- and third-line regimens in resource-limited settings where subtype C predominates.</td>

      <td>Iron status predicts treatment failure and mortality in tuberculosis patients: a prospective cohort study from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Experimental data suggest a role for iron in the course of tuberculosis (TB) infection, but there is limited evidence on the potential effects of iron deficiency or iron overload on the progression of TB disease in humans. The aim of the present analysis was to examine the association of iron status with the risk of TB progression and death. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed plasma samples and data collected as part a randomized micronutrient supplementation trial (not including iron) among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected TB patients in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We prospectively related baseline plasma ferritin concentrations from 705 subjects (362 HIV-infected and 343 HIV-uninfected) to the risk of treatment failure at one month after initiation, TB recurrence and death using binomial and Cox regression analyses. Overall, low (plasma ferritin<30 microg/L) and high (plasma ferritin>150 microg/L for women and>200 microg/L for men) iron status were seen in 9% and 48% of patients, respectively. Compared with normal levels, low plasma ferritin predicted an independent increased risk of treatment failure overall (adjusted RR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.07 to 3.52) and of TB recurrence among HIV-infected patients (adjusted RR = 4.21, 95% CI: 1.22 to 14.55). High plasma ferritin, independent of C-reactive protein concentrations, was associated with an increased risk of overall mortality (adjusted RR = 3.02, 95% CI: 1.95 to 4.67). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Both iron deficiency and overload exist in TB patients and may contribute to disease progression and poor clinical outcomes. Strategies to maintain normal iron status in TB patients could be helpful to reduce TB morbidity and mortality.</td>

      <td>A pharmacovigilance study of adults on highly active antiretroviral therapy, South Africa: 2007 - 2011.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Of the 1.6 million South African people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), approximately 970,000 (55%) have been initiated on HAART. Despite these numbers, very little has been published about the safety profile of antiretroviral (ARV) medicines in the country. This study was performed at the Medunsa National Pharmacovigilance Centre and aimed to describe the demographic characteristics of patients enrolled in the pharmacovigilance surveillance study; highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation regimen patterns; reasons for regimen changes; and adverse effects of ARV medicines. METHODS: A cohort study of HIV-infected individuals aged 15 years or older who were on ARV medicines was conducted at four sentinel sites. RESULTS: After HAART initiation, with an average lapse of 17.8 months (range: 0 - 83.8 months), 2,815 patients were enrolled into the study. Results show that patients were observed for 1,606.2 person-years for pharmacy visits (collection of ARV medicines) and 817.1 person-years for clinical visits (consultation with the doctor). Females constituted 69.6% (1,958/2,815) of the study population. Almost all patients initiated HAART on first-line regimens (2,801/2,815). Some patients (6.7%, 190/2,815) dropped out of the study after HAART initiation. Reasons for regimen changes were not recorded for 2.5% (22/891) of the patients who changed regimens. The primary reason for regimen changes was drug-related toxicity (76.1%, 678/891), mostly evident in patients taking first-line regimens. Adverse effects experienced by patients were polyneuropathy (24.0%, 163/678); lipodystrophy (23.9%, 162/678); neuropathy (10.6%, 72/678); and suspected lactic acidosis (3.8%, 26/678). CONCLUSION: The majority of prescribers complied with the HAART guidelines and initiated most patients on first-line regimens. However, adverse effects are evident in patients taking first-line regimens. We recommend that the Department of Health should introduce less toxic first-line ARV regimens. Future efforts will aim to initiate patients on HAART and enrol them into the study simultaneously to determine early risk profiles of ARV medicines.</td>

      <td>SETTING AND OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in two gold-mining workforces, South Africa, 2002-2008. DESIGN: TB programme data analysis. RESULTS: TB case notification rates decreased between 2002 and 2008 from 4006 to 3018 per 100,000 and from 3192 to 2468/100,000 for Companies A and B, respectively. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence exceeded 80% in TB episodes with known status. The proportion of TB episodes with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) increased from 6/129 (4.7%) to 17/85 (20.0%) among previously treated cases, and from 4/38 (10.4%) to 7/28 (25.0%) in Companies A and B, respectively (tests for trend, Company A, P < 0.001; Company B, P = 0.304). Case notifications of MDR-TB increased during 2002-2008 from 39.8 to 122.9/100,000/year in Company A and from 7.8 to 96.8/100,000/year in Company B. Coverage of second-line drug susceptibility testing (DST) among MDR-TB episodes was low. Previous treatment exposure was a strong risk factor for MDR-TB (prevalence ratio 8.78, 95%CI 5.94-12.97 in previously treated vs. untreated individuals). CONCLUSION: Despite decreasing TB notifications overall, MDR-TB notifications and proportions of episodes with MDR-TB increased in the larger company. Cure must be ensured in first episodes to prevent acquired resistance. Improved coverage of culture, DST and HIV testing is required to allow treatment to be optimised.</td>

      <td>The evolving epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis among children in Cape Town, South Africa.</td>
      <td>SETTING: Tygerberg Children's Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and trend of drug resistance and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection among children with culture-confirmed tuberculosis (TB). METHOD: Prospective surveillance from March 2007 to February 2009, compared to three previous surveys (1994-1998, 2003-2005, 2005-2007). Drug susceptibility testing (DST) against isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP) was performed using genotypic and phenotypic testing. If multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was detected, further DST against ethambutol (EMB) and second-line drugs was performed. RESULTS: A total of 294 children with a median age of 26 months (range 3 days-13 years) were diagnosed with culture-confirmed TB. DST results were available for 292 (99.3%); 41 (14%) were INH-resistant, including 26 (8.9%) with MDR-TB. Four children (1.4%) had RMP monoresistance. EMB resistance was present in 12/24 (50%) MDR-TB cases tested. Two isolates were resistant to ofloxacin; none had extensively drug-resistant TB. Of those tested, 29% (63/217) were HIV-infected. Any resistance to RMP increased between 1994 and 2009 (P < 0.001), as did RMP monoresistance (P = 0.009) and MDR-TB (P < 0.001). Sensitivity was 87.5% and specificity 100% for genotypic compared to phenotypic testing for INH resistance. CONCLUSIONS: RMP, and consequently multidrug, resistance is increasing among children with TB in this setting. EMB resistance is common among children with resistance to RMP and INH.</td>

      <td>Virological failure and drug resistance in patients on antiretroviral therapy after treatment interruption in Lilongwe, Malawi.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Since 2004, Malawi has rapidly scaled up access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the national program following a public health approach with limited laboratory monitoring. We examined virological outcomes in patients with treatment interruption at 2 clinics of the Lighthouse Trust, Lilongwe, Malawi. METHODS: We evaluated patients who resumed first-line ART after having at least 1 treatment interruption documented in the electronic data system in 2008-2009. Viral load (VL) was analyzed at least 2 months after resumption of ART. For VL >/=1000 copies/mL, drug-resistance genotype was characterized using the Stanford database. RESULTS: Between June and November 2009, we enrolled 133 patients (58.7% female) with a mean age of 38.4 years. Mean duration of ART prior to treatment interruption was 14.3 months. After a minimum of 2 months following ART resumption, VL was undetectable in 81 (60.9%) patients, was 400-1000 copies/mL in 12 (9.0%) patients, and was >/=1000 copies/mL in 40 (30.1%) patients. Genotyping and drug-resistance testing were successfully performed for 36 of 40 patients, all carrying human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtype C. Relevant mutations affecting nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors were found in 32 of 133 (24.1%) patients and combined with relevant nucleoside reverse transcriptase mutations in 27 of 133 (20.3%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Virological failure combined with drug resistance after resumption of first-line ART occurred in 24.1% of the patients with treatment interruption, requiring a switch to protease inhibitor-based second-line therapy. Patients with treatment interruption should receive VL assessment after resumption of ART to detect treatment failure and to reduce development and spread of drug resistance.</td>

The Malawi Ministry of Health conducts periodic evaluations of HIVDR development in prospective cohorts at sentinel clinics. We evaluated viral load suppression, HIVDR, and factors associated with HIVDR in 4 ART sites at 12-15 months after ART initiation. More than 70% of patients initiating ART had viral suppression at 12 months. HIVDR prevalence (6.1%) after 12 months of ART was low and largely associated with baseline HIVDR. Better follow-up, removal of barriers to on-time drug pickups, and adherence education for patients 16-24 years of age may further prevent HIVDR.</td>

      <td>Clinical practice guidelines for management of neuropathic pain: expert panel recommendations for South Africa.</td>
      <td>Neuropathic pain (NeuP) is challenging to diagnose and manage, despite ongoing improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Many patients do not respond satisfactorily to existing treatments. There are no published guidelines for diagnosis or management of NeuP in South Africa. A multidisciplinary expert panel critically reviewed available evidence to provide consensus recommendations for diagnosis and management of NeuP in South Africa. Following accurate diagnosis of NeuP, pregabalin, gabapentin, low-dose tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine and venlafaxine) are all recommended as first-line options for the treatment of peripheral NeuP. If the response is insufficient after 2 - 4 weeks, the recommended next step is to switch to a different class, or combine different classes of agent. Opioids should be reserved for use later in the treatment pathway, if switching drugs and combination therapy fails. For central NeuP, pregabalin or amitriptyline are recommended as first-line agents. Companion treatments (cognitive behavioural therapy and physical therapy) should be administered as part of a multidisciplinary approach. Dorsal root entry zone rhizotomy (DREZ) is not recommended to treat NeuP. Given the large population of HIV/AIDS patients in South Africa, and the paucity of positive efficacy data for its management, research in the form of randomised controlled trials in painful HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) must be prioritised in this country.</td>

      <td>From 2006 to 2011, a cohort study was conducted among 1000 children resident in urban and rural settings of Uganda to ascertain and compare the response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among urban versus rural children and the factors associated with this response. Clinical, immunological, and virological parameters were ascertained at baseline and weeks 24, 48, 96, and 144 after ART initiation. Adherence to ART was assessed at enrollment by self-report (SR) and pill counts (PC). Overall, 499/948 (52.6%) children were resident in rural areas, 504/948 (53.1%) were male, and their mean age was 11.9+/-4.4 years (urban children) and 11.4+/-4.1 years (rural children). The urban children were more likely to switch to second-line ART at a rate of 39.9 per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 28.2-56.4) versus 14.9 per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 8.7-25.7), p=0.0038, develop any new WHO 3/4 events at 127/414 (30.7%) versus 108/466 (23.2%), p=0.012, and have a higher cumulative incidence of hospitalization of 54/449 (12.0%) versus 32/499 (6.4%), p=0.003, when compared to rural children. No differences were observed in mean changes in weight, height, CD4 count and percentage, and hemoglobin and viral load between urban and rural children. Adherence of >/=95% was observed in 88.2% of urban versus 91.3% of rural children by SR (p=0.130), and in 78.8% of urban versus 88.8% of rural children by PC (p<0.0001). In this study rural children had more favorable clinical outcomes and were more likely to adhere optimally to ART than urban children.</td>

      <td>Maternal and infant antiretroviral regimens to prevent postnatal HIV-1 transmission: 48-week follow-up of the BAN randomised controlled trial.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In resource-limited settings where no safe alternative to breastfeeding exists, WHO recommends that antiretroviral prophylaxis be given to either HIV-infected mothers or infants throughout breastfeeding. We assessed the effect of 28 weeks of maternal or infant antiretroviral prophylaxis on postnatal HIV infection at 48 weeks. METHODS: The Breastfeeding, Antiretrovirals, and Nutrition (BAN) Study was undertaken in Lilongwe, Malawi, between April 21, 2004, and Jan 28, 2010. 2369 HIV-infected breastfeeding mothers with a CD4 count of 250 cells per muL or more and their newborn babies were randomly assigned with a variable-block design to one of three, 28-week regimens: maternal triple antiretroviral (n=849); daily infant nevirapine (n=852); or control (n=668). Patients and local clinical staff were not masked to treatment allocation, but other study investigators were. All mothers and infants received one dose of nevirapine (mother 200 mg; infant 2 mg/kg) and 7 days of zidovudine (mother 300 mg; infants 2 mg/kg) and lamivudine (mothers 150 mg; infants 4 mg/kg) twice a day. Mothers were advised to wean between 24 weeks and 28 weeks after birth. The primary endpoint was HIV infection by 48 weeks in infants who were not infected at 2 weeks and in all infants randomly assigned with censoring at loss to follow-up. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00164736. FINDINGS: 676 mother-infant pairs completed follow-up to 48 weeks or reached an endpoint in the maternal-antiretroviral group, 680 in the infant-nevirapine group, and 542 in the control group. By 32 weeks post partum, 96% of women in the intervention groups and 88% of those in the control group reported no breastfeeding since their 28-week visit. 30 infants in the maternal-antiretroviral group, 25 in the infant-nevirapine group, and 38 in the control group became HIV infected between 2 weeks and 48 weeks of life; 28 (30%) infections occurred after 28 weeks (nine in maternal-antiretroviral, 13 in infant-nevirapine, and six in control groups). The cumulative risk of HIV-1 transmission by 48 weeks was significantly higher in the control group (7%, 95% CI 5-9) than in the maternal-antiretroviral (4%, 3-6; p=0.0273) or the infant-nevirapine (4%, 2-5; p=0.0027) groups. The rate of serious adverse events in infants was significantly higher during 29-48 weeks than during the intervention phase (1.1 [95% CI 1.0-1.2] vs 0.7 [0.7-0.8] per 100 person-weeks; p<0.0001), with increased risk of diarrhoea, malaria, growth faltering, tuberculosis, and death. Nine women died between 2 weeks and 48 weeks post partum (one in maternal-antiretroviral group, two in infant-nevirapine group, six in control group). INTERPRETATION: In resource-limited settings where no suitable alternative to breastfeeding is available, antiretroviral prophylaxis given to mothers or infants might decrease HIV transmission. Weaning at 6 months might increase infant morbidity. FUNDING: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</td>

      <td>Prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in antiretroviral therapy naive HIV-positive patients and the impact on treatment outcomes--a retrospective study from a large urban cohort in Johannesburg, South Africa.</td>
      <td>Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is associated with advanced HIV disease and may be a complication of antiretroviral therapy (ART) or anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs, specifically isoniazid (INH). The effect of non-ART-drug-related PN on treatment outcomes is yet to be determined. We analysed prospectively collected cohort data for HIV-infected ART-naive adults initiating ART at the Themba Lethu Clinic, Johannesburg, South Africa from June 2004 to June 2009. Patients who presented with signs and symptoms of numbness or dysesthesia prior to initiation of ART were defined as having PN. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the effect of PN alone (HIV-related PN) or PN with a history of INH use (TB-related PN) on mortality, lost to follow-up (LTFU), persistent and recurrent PN by 12 months of follow-up. Of the 9,399 patients initiating ART, 3.9 % had HIV-related PN while a further 1.8 % had TB-related PN. Patients with PN did not have a significantly higher risk of mortality compared to those without PN (hazard ratio (HR) 1.17 95 % CI 0.92-1.49). Patients with TB-related PN were less likely to be LTFU by 12 months (HR 0.65 95 % CI 0.44-0.97) compared to those without PN. Patients with HIV-related PN were at increased risk of persistent PN at 3 months post-ART initiation. Patients with HIV-related PN had a similar risk of recurrent PN compared to those with TB-related PN (HR 1.28 95 % CI 0.72-2.27). We demonstrate that patients with PN at initiation of ART present with advanced HIV disease. Completion of TB treatment may reduce the risk of persistent PN in patients with TB-related PN. Use of HIV drugs, even neurotoxic ones, may overall limit neuropathy.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: The risk of death is highest in the first few months after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We examined whether initial CD4 cell count maintains a strong prognostic value among patients with at least 6 months follow-up after the initiation of ART. DESIGN: Observational study of HIV patients in Uganda aged 14 years or older enrolled in 10 clinics across Uganda. METHODS: Baseline CD4 cell count of patients with more than 6 months of follow-up were stratified into categories (<50, 50-99, 100-149, 150-249, >250 cells/mul). A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model the associations between baseline CD4 cell count and mortality. RESULTS: Of 22 315 patients, 20 730 (92.8%) had more than 6 months of follow-up. Six hundred and eleven (2.9%) patients died during follow-up and 737 (3.6%) were lost to follow-up. Relative to a baseline CD4 cell counts of less than 50 cells/mul, the adjusted hazard ratios for death were 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-1.02], 0.71 (95% CI 0.57-0.88), 0.52 (95% CI 0.42-0.64), and 0.55 (95% CI 0.42-0.70) favouring those with baseline CD4 cell counts of 50-99, 100-149, 150-249, and at least 250 cells/mul, respectively. Differing ages and male sex increased the likelihood of mortality. CONCLUSION: Among patients with more than 6 months of follow-up after initiation of ART, baseline CD4 cell count at initiation still has important prognostic value. This suggests that active engagement and earlier treatment initiation is important for long-term survival.</td>

      <td>Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy reduces HIV-related infant mortality. The early peak of pediatric HIV-related deaths in South Africa occurs at 3 months of age, coinciding with the earliest age at which treatment is initiated following PCR testing at 6 weeks of age. Earlier diagnosis is necessary to reduce infant mortality. The performances of the Amplicor DNA PCR, COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan (CAP/CTM), and Aptima assays for detecting early HIV infection (acquired in utero and intrapartum) up to 6 weeks of age were compared. Dried blood spots (DBS) were collected at birth and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks from HIV-exposed infants enrolled in an observational cohort study in Johannesburg, South Africa. HIV status was determined at 6 weeks by DNA PCR on whole blood. Serial DBS samples from all HIV-infected infants and two HIV-uninfected, age-matched controls were tested with the 3 assays. Of 710 infants of known HIV status, 38 (5.4%) had in utero (n = 29) or intrapartum (n = 9) infections. By 14 weeks, when treatment should have been initiated, 13 (45%) in utero-infected and 2 (22%) intrapartum-infected infants had died or were lost to follow-up. The CAP/CTM and Aptima assays identified 76.3% of all infants with early HIV infections at birth and by 4 weeks were 96% sensitive. DNA PCR demonstrated lower sensitivities at birth and 4 weeks of 68.4% and 87.5%, respectively. All assays had the lowest sensitivity at 2 weeks of age. CAP/CTM was the only assay with 100% specificity at all ages. Testing at birth versus 6 weeks of age identifies a higher total number of HIV-infected infants, irrespective of the assay.</td>

In this work we analyzed 57 integrase sequences obtained from samples from drug-naive and first line regime-failing patients from Maputo, Mozambique, to evaluate the presence of natural polymorphisms and resistance mutations associated with raltegravir and elvitegravir. No major mutations conferring resistance to integrase inhibitors were found and polymorphic accessory mutations were solely observed in low frequency among subtype C sequences-L74M (3.4%), T97A (1.8%), and E157Q (1.8%)-suggesting that this new antiretroviral drug class will be effective in Mozambique providing a good perspective to the introduction of this class of drugs in that country.</td>

      <td>Low sputum smear positive tuberculosis among pulmonary tuberculosis suspects in a tertiary hospital in Mwanza, Tanzania.</td>
      <td>Early diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) and prompt initiation of treatment are essential for an effective tuberculosis control programme. In many resource limited settings microscopic diagnosis is still the pivotal tool in the diagnosis of pulmonary TB. This study aimed at evaluating laboratory microscopic diagnosis of tuberculosis in a tertiary hospital in Mwanza, Tanzania. This retrospective hospital based study reviewed consecutively from TB registry and patients' files a total of 5,922 TB suspects who submitted their sputum for examination between January 2007 and May 2010 at Bugando Medical Centre (BMC). Among TB suspects (mean age=36.1+/-13.6 years) female accounted for 54.1% of the patients. The prevalence of HIV among TB patients was 59.4%. The sputum smear positivity rate among the TB suspects was 6.1%; the rate was higher in HIV positive than in HIV negative patients (9.9 % versus 3.2%, P-value < 0.001). The overall positivity rate for the first smear was 94.2% with an incremental percentage yield of 5.2% and 0.6% for the second and third smears, respectively. The study found that 28.6% of patients who were positive in the first smear did not return for the second smear. The risk factors among smear positive TB patients were co-illness (32.5%), previous history of TB (7.5%) and history of positive TB contact (4.7%). These findings also show that as CD4+ T Cells count increases, the quantity AFB in sputum smear also increase although not statistically significant. The sputum smear positivity rate at Bugando Medical Centre is low and more than a quarter of initial TB suspects who were positive in the first smear were lost to follow up posing a threat of continuous transmission of tuberculosis to the community. The finding of more sputum smear positivity rate among HIV positive than HIV negative patients at BMC requires a prospective study to ascertain whether it is a reality or a coincidence.</td>

      <td>We analyzed antiretroviral drug susceptibility in HIV-infected adults failing first- and second-line antiretroviral treatment (ART) in Rakai, Uganda. Samples obtained from participants at baseline (pretreatment) and at the time of failure on first-line ART and second-line ART were analyzed using genotypic and phenotypic assays for antiretroviral drug resistance. Test results were obtained from 73 samples from 38 individuals (31 baseline samples, 36 first-line failure samples, and six second-line failure samples). Four (13%) of the 31 baseline samples had mutations associated with resistance to nucleoside or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs, respectively). Among the 36 first-line failure samples, 31 (86%) had NNRTI resistance mutations and 29 (81%) had lamivudine resistance mutations; only eight (22%) had other NRTI resistance mutations. None of the six individuals failing a second-line protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen had PI resistance mutations. Six (16%) of the participants had discordant genotypic and phenotypic test results. Genotypic resistance to drugs included in first-line ART regimens was detected prior to treatment and among participants failing first-line ART. PI resistance was not detected in individuals failing second-line ART. Surveillance for transmitted and acquired drug resistance remains a priority for scale-up of ART.</td>

      <td>Not all are lost: interrupted laboratory monitoring, early death, and loss to follow-up (LTFU) in a large South African treatment program.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Many HIV treatment programs in resource-limited settings are plagued by high rates of loss to follow-up (LTFU). Most studies have not distinguished between those who briefly interrupt, but return to care, and those more chronically lost to follow-up. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 11,397 adults initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 71 Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference/Catholic Relief Services HIV treatment clinics between January 2004 and December 2008. We distinguished among patients with early death, within the first 7 months on ART; patients with interruptions in laboratory monitoring (ILM), defined as missing visits in the first 7 months on ART, but returning to care by 12 months; and those LTFU, defined as missing all follow-up visits in the first 12 months on ART. We used multilevel logistic regression models to determine patient and clinic-level characteristics associated with these outcomes. RESULTS: In the first year on ART, 60% of patients remained in care, 30% missed laboratory visits, and 10% suffered early death. Of the 3,194 patients who missed laboratory visits, 40% had ILM, resuming care by 12 months. After 12 months on ART, patients with ILM had a 30% increase in detectable viremia compared to those who remained in care. Risk of LTFU decreased with increasing enrollment year, and was lowest for patients who enrolled in 2008 compared to 2004 [OR 0.49, 95%CI 0.39-0.62]. CONCLUSIONS: In a large community-based cohort in South Africa, nearly 30% of patients miss follow-up visits for CD4 monitoring in the first year after starting ART. Of those, 40% have ILM but return to clinic with worse virologic outcomes than those who remain in care. The risk of chronic LTFU decreased with enrollment year. As ART availability increases, interruptions in care may become more common, and should be accounted for in addressing program LTFU.</td>

      <td>An observational cohort comparison of facilitators of retention in care and adherence to anti-eetroviral therapy at an HIV treatment center in Kenya.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Most HIV treatment programs in resource-limited settings utilize multiple facilitators of adherence and retention in care but there is little data on the efficacy of these methods. We performed an observational cohort analysis of a treatment program in Kenya to assess which program components promote adherence and retention in HIV care in East Africa. METHODS: Patients initiating ART at A.I.C. Kijabe Hospital were prospectively enrolled in an observational study. Kijabe has an intensive program to promote adherence and retention in care during the first 6 months of ART that incorporates the following facilitators: home visits by community health workers, community based support groups, pharmacy counseling, and unannounced pill counts by clinicians. The primary endpoint was time to treatment failure, defined as a detectable HIV-1 viral load; discontinuation of ART; death; or loss to follow-up. Time to treatment failure for each facilitator was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The relative effects of the facilitators were determined by the Cox Proportional Hazards Model. RESULTS: 301 patients were enrolled. Time to treatment failure was longer in patients participating in support groups (448 days vs. 337 days, P<0.001), pharmacy counseling (480 days vs. 386 days, P = 0.002), pill counts (482 days vs. 189 days, P<0.001) and home visits (485 days vs. 426 days, P = 0.024). Better adherence was seen with support groups (89% vs. 82%, P = 0.05) and pill counts (89% vs. 75%, P = 0.02). Multivariate analysis using the Cox Model found significant reductions in risk of treatment failure associated with pill counts (HR = 0.19, P<0.001) and support groups (HR = 0.43, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Unannounced pill counts by the clinician and community based support groups were associated with better long term treatment success and with better adherence.</td>

      <td>Virologic failure of protease inhibitor-based second-line antiretroviral therapy without resistance in a large HIV treatment program in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: We investigated the prevalence of wild-type virus (no major drug resistance) and drug resistance mutations at second-line antiretroviral treatment (ART) failure in a large HIV treatment program in South Africa. METHODOLOGY/ PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: HIV-infected patients >/= 15 years of age who had failed protease inhibitor (PI)-based second-line ART (2 consecutive HIV RNA tests >1000 copies/ml on lopinavir/ritonavir, didanosine, and zidovudine) were identified retrospectively. Patients with virologic failure were continued on second-line ART. Genotypic testing for drug resistance was performed on frozen plasma samples obtained closest to and after the date of laboratory confirmed second-line ART failure. Of 322 HIV-infected patients on second-line ART, 43 were adults with confirmed virologic failure, and 33 had available plasma for viral sequencing. HIV-1 RNA subtype C predominated (n = 32, 97%). Mean duration on ART (SD) prior to initiation of second-line ART was 23 (17) months, and time from second-line ART initiation to failure was 10 (9) months. Plasma samples were obtained 7(9) months from confirmed failure. At second-line failure, 22 patients (67%) had wild-type virus. There was no major resistance to PIs found. Eleven of 33 patients had a second plasma sample taken 8 (5.5) months after the first. Median HIV-1 RNA and the genotypic resistance profile were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS/ SIGNIFICANCE: Most patients who failed second-line ART had wild-type virus. We did not observe evolution of resistance despite continuation of PI-based ART after failure. Interventions that successfully improve adherence could allow patients to continue to benefit from second-line ART therapy even after initial failure.</td>

      <td>Switching children previously exposed to nevirapine to nevirapine-based treatment after initial suppression with a protease-inhibitor-based regimen: long-term follow-up of a randomised, open-label trial.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Protease-inhibitor-based treatment is recommended as first-line for infants infected with HIV who have been previously exposed to nevirapine prophylaxis. However, long-term use poses adherence challenges, is associated with metabolic toxic effects, restricts second-line options, and is costly. We present the long-term outcomes of switching nevirapine-exposed children to nevirapine-based treatment after effective suppression of virus replication with a protease-inhibitor-based regimen. METHODS: We did a randomised trial to compare long-term viral suppression with nevirapine-based versus protease-inhibitor-based (ritonavir-boosted lopinavir) treatment in children who had achieved suppression with protease-inhibitor-based treatment. Randomisation (1:1) was by cohort blocks of variable size between eight and 12. Eligible children were younger than 24 months who were previously exposed to nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and achieved virological suppression of less than 400 copies per mL when treated with the regimen based on ritonavir-boosted lopinavir in Johannesburg, South Africa. We gave all drugs as liquids and adjusted doses at each visit in accordance with growth. We continued follow-up for a minimum of 90 weeks and maximum of 232 weeks after randomisation. We quantified HIV RNA every 3 months. Our primary endpoint was any viraemia greater than 50 copies per mL. Our analysis was by modified intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00117728. FINDINGS: We followed up the children for a median of 156 weeks and there were three deaths in each group. Children in the switch group (Kaplan-Meier probability 0.595) were less likely to experience non-suppression greater than 50 copies per mL than in the control group (0.687; p=0.01) and had better CD4 and growth responses initially after switching (52 children in the switch group vs 66 control group met this endpoint). By 156 weeks after randomisation, more children had virological failure--which we defined as confirmed viraemia of more than 1000 copies per mL--in the switch group (22 children) than in the control group (ten children; p=0.009). We detected all 22 failures in the switch group by 52 weeks compared with five in the control group. Virological failure was related to non-adherence and pretreatment drug resistance. In children without pretreatment drug resistance, we did not identify a significant difference in virological failure between the switch (Kaplan-Meier probability 0.140) and control (0.095) groups (p=0.34; seven failures in the switch group vs five in the control group). Children in the switch group were significantly more likely to develop grade 1-3 alanine aminotransferase abnormalities over the duration of follow-up. INTERPRETATION: Viral-load testing through 52 weeks can identify all children likely to fail this protease-inhibitor-switch strategy. Switching children once suppressed to a nevirapine-based regimen might be a valuable treatment option if adequate viral-load monitoring can be done.

      <td>Elevated alanine aminotransferase in antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected African patients: magnitude and risk factors.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is commonly used to measure liver injury in resource-limited settings. Elevations in ALT are predictive of increased mortality from liver disease and may influence the choice of first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of the prevalence and predictors of elevated ALT (defined as >40 IU/L) was conducted. ART-naive, HIV-infected adults with a baseline ALT measurement who were enrolled in any of the 18 HIV Care and Treatment Clinics in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania between November 2004 and December 2009 were included in the study. Median values were calculated and log-binomial regression models were used to examine predictors of elevated ALT. RESULTS: During the study period, 41891 adults had a baseline ALT measurement performed. The prevalence of ALT >40, >120 and >200 IU/L was 13, 1 and 0.3%, respectively. In multivariate analyses, male sex, CD4 T lymphocyte count <200 cells/muL and higher World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stages were associated with a significantly higher risk of ALT >40 IU/L (all P<0.01). Hypertryglyceridaemia, hyperglycaemia and hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection (positive for HBV surface antigen) were significantly associated with a higher risk of elevated ALT. Pregnancy, anaemia, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >130 mg/dL and current tuberculosis treatment were associated with a significantly reduced risk for elevated ALT. CONCLUSIONS: In this HIV-infected, ART-naive Tanzanian population, extreme elevations in ALT were infrequent but minor elevations were not uncommon. Antiretrovirals with potentially hepatotoxic side effects should be initiated with caution in male patients, and in patients with HBV coinfection, advanced immunosuppression and components of the metabolic syndrome.</td>

      <td>Effects of a reduced dose of stavudine on the incidence and severity of peripheral neuropathy in HIV-infected adults in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Although recent World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend withdrawing stavudine (d4T) from first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART), it remains commonly used in resource-limited settings. In 2006, WHO recommended decreasing the dose of d4T from 40 mg to 30 mg to mitigate toxicities. We compared the incidence and severity of peripheral neuropathy by d4T dose in a retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Patients' charts from an ART-naive population at a rural clinic in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, were retrospectively reviewed for signs and symptoms of incident peripheral neuropathy and were graded for severity using the DAIDS scale. Patients enrolled prior to the WHO guideline change were included in the study if they were on d4T 40 mg for >/=6 months. After the guideline change all patients were initiated on d4T 30 mg. RESULTS: A total of 475 patients were analysed, including 235 in the 40 mg cohort (152.7 person-years [py]) and 240 in the 30 mg cohort (244.7 py). Incidence of peripheral neuropathy was 90.4/100 py (95% CI 75.9, 106.8) in the 40 mg cohort versus 40.5/100 py (95% CI 32.9, 49.3) in the 30 mg group (incidence rate ratio 0.45; P<0.0001). There was no difference in proportion of severe peripheral neuropathy cases (grade 3/4) between the cohorts: 8.3% in the 40 mg group and 8.9% in the 30 mg group (P=1.0). In a multivariate analysis, risk of peripheral neuropathy was associated with increasing age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.65, 95% CI 1.24, 2.19), 40 mg dose (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.61, 2.74) and concurrent tuberculosis therapy (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.06, 1.87). CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of peripheral neuropathy in the 40 mg cohort was extremely high and, although lower, the rate in the 30 mg cohort was nonetheless unacceptably high.</td>

      <td>Effectiveness and safety of 30 mg versus 40 mg stavudine regimens: a cohort study among HIV-infected adults initiating HAART in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: As stavudine remains an important and widely prescribed drug in resource-limited settings, the effect of a reduced dose of stavudine (from 40 mg to 30 mg) on outcomes of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) remains an important public health question. METHODS: We analyzed prospectively collected data from the Themba Lethu Clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa. We assessed the relationship between stavudine dose and six- and/or 12-month outcomes of stavudine substitution, failure to suppress viral load to below 400 copies/ml, development of peripheral neuropathy, lipoatrophy and hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis. Since individuals with a baseline weight of less than 60 kg were expected to have received the same dose of stavudine throughout the study period, analysis was restricted to individuals who weighed 60 kg or more at baseline. Data were analyzed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Between 1 April 2004 and 30 September 2009, 3910 patients were initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with a recorded stavudine dose and were included in the analysis. Of these, 2445 (62.5%) received a 40 mg stavudine dose while 1565 (37.5%) received 30 mg. In multivariate analysis, patients receiving a 40 mg dose were more likely to discontinue stavudine use (adjusted odds ratio, OR 1.71; 95% confidence limits, CI 1.13-2.57) than those receiving 30 mg by 12 months on ART. Additionally, patients receiving 40 mg doses of stavudine were more likely to report peripheral neuropathy (OR 3.12; 95% CI 1.86-5.25), lipoatrophy (OR 11.8; 95% CI 3.2-43.8) and hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis (OR 8.37; 95% CI 3.83-18.29) in the same time period. Failure to suppress HIV viral load within 12 months of HAART initiation was somewhat more common among those given 40 mg doses (OR 1.62; 95% CI 0.88, 2.97) although this result lacked precision. Sensitivity analyses accounting for death and loss to follow up generally supported these estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Lower stavudine dosage is associated with fewer reports of several stavudine-associated adverse events and also a lower risk of stavudine discontinuation within the first year on ART.</td>

      <td>Linking women who test HIV-positive in pregnancy-related services to long-term HIV care and treatment services: a systematic review.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: To quantify attrition between women testing HIV-positive in pregnancy-related services and accessing long-term HIV care and treatment services in low- or middle-income countries and to explore the reasons underlying client drop-out by synthesising current literature on this topic. METHODS: A systematic search in Medline, EMBASE, Global Health and the International Bibliography of the Social Sciences of literature published 2000-2010. Only studies meeting pre-defined quality criteria were included. RESULTS: Of 2543 articles retrieved, 20 met the inclusion criteria. Sixteen (80%) drew on data from sub-Saharan Africa. The pathway between testing HIV-positive in pregnancy-related services and accessing long-term HIV-related services is complex, and attrition was usually high. There was a failure to initiate highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among 38-88% of known-eligible women. Providing 'family-focused care', and integrating CD4 testing and HAART provision into prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services appear promising for increasing women's uptake of HIV-related services. Individual-level factors that need to be addressed include financial constraints and fear of stigma. CONCLUSIONS: Too few women negotiate the many steps between testing HIV-positive in pregnancy-related services and accessing HIV-related services for themselves. Recent efforts to stem patient drop-out, such as the MTCT-Plus Initiative, hold promise. Addressing barriers and enabling factors both within health facilities and at the levels of the individual woman, her family and society will be essential to improve the uptake of services.</td>

      <td>Comparison of methods to correct survival estimates and survival regression analysis on a large HIV African cohort.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: The evaluation of HIV treatment programs is generally based on an estimation of survival among patients receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART). In large HIV programs, loss to follow-up (LFU) rates remain high despite active patient tracing, which is likely to bias survival estimates and survival regression analyses. METHODS: We compared uncorrected survival estimates derived from routine program data with estimates obtained by applying six correction methods that use updated outcome data by a field survey targeting LFU patients in a rural HIV program in Malawi. These methods were based on double-sampling and differed according to the weights given to survival estimates in LFU and non-LFU subpopulations. We then proposed a correction of the survival regression analysis. RESULTS: Among 6,727 HIV-infected adults receiving ART, 9% were LFU after one year. The uncorrected survival estimates from routine data were 91% in women and 84% in men. According to increasing sophistication of the correction methods, the corrected survival estimates ranged from 89% to 85% in women and 82% to 77% in men. The estimates derived from uncorrected regression analyses were highly biased for initial tuberculosis mortality ratios (RR; 95% CI: 1.07; 0.76-1.50 vs. 2.06 to 2.28 with different correction weights), Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis (2.11; 1.61-2.76 vs. 2.64 to 3.9), and year of ART initiation (1.40; 1.17-1.66 vs. 1.29 to 1.34). CONCLUSIONS: In HIV programs with high LFU rates, the use of correction methods based on non-exhaustive double-sampling data are necessary to minimise the bias in survival estimates and survival regressions.</td>

      <td>Gender differences in immune reconstitution: a multicentric cohort analysis in sub-Saharan Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, men living with HIV often start ART at more advanced stages of disease and have higher early mortality than women. We investigated gender difference in long-term immune reconstitution. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Antiretroviral-naive adults who received ART for at least 9 months in four HIV programs in sub-Saharan Africa were included. Multivariate mixed linear models were used to examine gender differences in immune reconstitution on first line ART. A total of 21,708 patients (68% women) contributed to 61,912 person-years of follow-up. At ART start,. Median CD4 at ART were 149 [IQR 85-206] for women and 125 cells/microL [IQR 63-187] for men. After the first year on ART, immune recovery was higher in women than in men, and gender-based differences increased by 20 CD4 cells/microL per year on average (95% CI 16-23; P<0.001). Up to 6 years after ART start, patients with low initial CD4 levels experienced similar gains compared to patients with high initial levels, including those with CD4>250 cells/microL (difference between patients with <50 cells/microL and those with >250 was 284 cells/microL; 95% CI 272-296; LR test for interaction with time p = 0.63). Among patients with initial CD4 count of 150-200 cells/microL, women reached 500 CD4 cells after 2.4 years on ART (95% CI 2.4-2.5) and men after 4.5 years (95% CI 4.1-4.8) of ART use. CONCLUSION: Women achieved better long-term immune response to ART, reaching CD4 level associated with lower risks of AIDS related morbidity and mortality quicker than men.</td>

      <td>Process and outcome evaluation of a community intervention for orphan adolescents in western Kenya.</td>
      <td>We conducted a 2-year pilot randomized controlled trial (N = 105) in a high HIV-prevalence area in rural western Kenya to test whether providing young orphan adolescents with uniforms, school fees, and community visitors improves school retention and reduces HIV risk factors. The trial was a community intervention, limited to one community. In this paper, we examined intervention implementation and its association with outcomes using longitudinal data. We used both quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the community-based model for orphan HIV prevention, with recommendations for future studies. Despite promising effects after 1 year, GEE analyses showed null effects after 2 years. Volunteer community visitors, a key element of the intervention, showed little of the expected effect although qualitative reports documented active assistance to prevent orphans' school absence. For future research, we recommend capturing the transition to high school, a larger sample size, and biomarker data to add strength to the research design. We also recommend a school-based intervention approach to improve implementation and reduce infrastructure costs. Finally, we recommend evaluating nurses as agents for improving school attendance and preventing dropout because of their unique ability to address critical biopsychosocial problems.</td>

      <td>HIV sero-positivity in recently admitted and long-term psychiatric in-patients: prevalence and diagnostic profile.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: Research on HIV in South Africa has not reflected the impact of the disease on psychiatric patients. The aims of the study were: to compare the HIV prevalence among patient groups in Weskoppies Hospital; to compare psychiatric diagnoses of infected and non-infected patients; to assess intravenous drug use and high-risk sexual behaviour; to establish HIV-syphilis Association; and to investigate the rapid test performance for screening, compared to the confirmatory ELISA test. METHOD: Onehundred-and-ninety-five patients were grouped into four categories according to their duration of admission and gender. HIV rapid testing, HIV ELISA, syphilis-RPR and TPHA testing were performed. RESULTS: The HIV prevalence of 11% in the sample was significantly associated with 'gender-and-duration-of-admission' categories (p = 0.003). No significant association between HIV infection and psychiatric diagnoses or intravenous drug use was found, but a significant association existed between HIV infection and high-risk sexual behaviour (p = 0.002), and between HIV and syphilis (p = 0.012). The HIV rapid screening test had a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 98.2%. CONCLUSION: The overall HIV prevalence at Weskoppies Hospital remains lower than the national average, but has increased since a previous local study. The rapid test for HIV had a lower sensitivity than was expected, and it is recommended that HIV ELISA testing be performed as a first line test in the setting of hospitalised patients. Due to the high prevalence of HIV and syphilis in the psychiatric population it is recommended that all patients be tested for both of these diseases.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVES: To project the clinical and economic outcomes of a genotype assay for selection of third-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited settings, as per the planned international A5288 trial (MULTI-OCTAVE). METHODS: We used the Cost-effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC)-International Model to compare three strategies for patients who have failed second-line ART in South Africa: sustained second-line: no genotype assay, all patients remain on second-line ART; A5288: genotype to determine the resistance profile and assign an appropriate regimen; or population-based third-line: no genotype, all patients switch to a potent third-line regimen. Model inputs are from published data in South Africa. Resistance profiles, ART regimens, and efficacy data were those used for trial planning. RESULTS: Projected life expectancy for sustained second-line, A5288, and population-based third-line are 61.1, 103.8, and 104.2 months. Compared to sustained second-line ($12 ,460), per person lifetime costs increase for the A5288 ($39, 250) and population-based ($44, 120) strategies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A5288, compared to sustained second-line, is $7500/year of life saved (YLS), and for population-based third-line, compared to A5288, is $154 ,500/YLS. In the A5288 strategy, very late presentation to care, coupled with lengthy delays to obtain the genotype, dramatically reduces 5-year survival, making the population-based third-line strategy more attractive. CONCLUSIONS: We project that, whereas the public health approach to third-line therapy is unaffordable, genotype assays and third-line ART in resource-limited settings will increase survival and be cost-effective compared to the population-based approach, supporting the value of an efficacy study.</td>

      <td>A clinician-nurse model to reduce early mortality and increase clinic retention among high-risk HIV-infected patients initiating combination antiretroviral treatment.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In resource-poor settings, mortality is at its highest during the first 3 months after combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) initiation. A clear predictor of mortality during this period is having a low CD4 count at the time of treatment initiation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect on survival and clinic retention of a nurse-based rapid assessment clinic for high-risk individuals initiating cART in a resource-constrained setting. METHODS: The USAID-AMPATH Partnership has enrolled more than 140,000 patients at 25 clinics throughout western Kenya. High Risk Express Care (HREC) provides weekly or bi-weekly rapid contacts with nurses for individuals initiating cART with CD4 counts of </=100 cells/mm3. All HIV-infected individuals aged 14 years or older initiating cART with CD4 counts of </=100 cells/mm3 were eligible for enrolment into HREC and for analysis. Adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) control for potential confounding using propensity score methods. RESULTS: Between March 2007 and March 2009, 4,958 patients initiated cART with CD4 counts of </=100 cells/mm3. After adjusting for age, sex, CD4 count, use of cotrimoxazole, treatment for tuberculosis, travel time to clinic and type of clinic, individuals in HREC had reduced mortality (AHR: 0.59; 95% confidence interval: 0.45-0.77), and reduced loss to follow up (AHR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.55-0.70) compared with individuals in routine care. Overall, patients in HREC were much more likely to be alive and in care after a median of nearly 11 months of follow up (AHR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.57-0.67). CONCLUSIONS: Frequent monitoring by dedicated nurses in the early months of cART can significantly reduce mortality and loss to follow up among high-risk patients initiating treatment in resource-constrained settings.</td>

      <td>Prognostic value of virological and immunological responses after 6 months of antiretroviral treatment in adults with HIV-1 infection in sub-Saharan Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: HIV RNA monitoring is not available in most antiretroviral treatment (ART) programs in sub-Saharan Africa; switch to second-line therapy is mostly guided by clinical/immunological criteria. This may lead to unnecessary disease progression and drug resistance accumulation. We investigated the prognostic value of virological and immunological status 6 months after ART initiation with respect to death, loss to follow-up, and treatment switch. METHODS: We considered treatment-naive HIV-1-infected patients, starting ART with available 6-month visit and subsequent follow-up, enrolled in a prospective cohort comprising 5 ART sites in 3 sub-Saharan countries. Outcome measures included the time from 6-month visit to death for all causes, loss to follow-up, and switch to second line. RESULTS: Of 2539 patients, 62% were females, their median pre-ART CD4 count was 215 cells per microliter, median HIV RNA 4.6 Log10 copies per milliliter, 30% were on WHO stage 3/4. At 6 months, 85% had HIV RNA <1000 copies per milliliter. During 3112 person-years follow-up after the 6-month visit, 91 patients died. Death was predicted by 6-month HIV RNA >/=10,000 copies per milliliter, adherence, and 6-month CD4 <200 cells per microliter. The 2-year estimated probability of surviving ranged from 0.69 (with 6-month HIV RNA >/=10,000 and CD4 <200) to 0.95 (with HIV RNA <1000 and CD4 >/=200). Loss to follow-up (1.95 per 100 person-years follow-up) was predicted by the 6-month HIV RNA >10,000 copies per milliliter and adherence but not by CD4. Switch to second line (6.94 per 100 person-years follow-up) was predicted by 6-month HIV RNA and CD4. CONCLUSIONS: In patients starting ART in sub-Saharan Africa, 6-month HIV RNA independently predicts subsequent survival, retention to care, and switch to second-line therapy. This measure warrants further evaluation as specific time point monitoring option.</td>

      <td>A causal framework for understanding the effect of losses to follow-up on epidemiologic analyses in clinic-based cohorts: the case of HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy in Africa.</td>
      <td>Although clinic-based cohorts are most representative of the "real world," they are susceptible to loss to follow-up. Strategies for managing the impact of loss to follow-up are therefore needed to maximize the value of studies conducted in these cohorts. The authors evaluated adult patients starting antiretroviral therapy at an HIV/AIDS clinic in Uganda, where 29% of patients were lost to follow-up after 2 years (January 1, 2004-September 30, 2007). Unweighted, inverse probability of censoring weighted (IPCW), and sampling-based approaches (using supplemental data from a sample of lost patients subsequently tracked in the community) were used to identify the predictive value of sex on mortality. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) were used to explore the structural basis for bias in each approach. Among 3,628 patients, unweighted and IPCW analyses found men to have higher mortality than women, whereas the sampling-based approach did not. DAGs encoding knowledge about the data-generating process, including the fact that death is a cause of being classified as lost to follow-up in this setting, revealed "collider" bias in the unweighted and IPCW approaches. In a clinic-based cohort in Africa, unweighted and IPCW approaches-which rely on the "missing at random" assumption-yielded biased estimates. A sampling-based approach can in general strengthen epidemiologic analyses conducted in many clinic-based cohorts, including those examining other diseases.</td>

      <td>Earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy, increased tuberculosis case finding and reduced mortality in a setting of improved HIV care: a retrospective cohort study.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: High early mortality after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation in resource-limited settings is associated with low baseline CD4 cell counts and a high burden of opportunistic infections. Our large urban HIV clinic in Uganda has made concerted efforts to initiate ART at higher CD4 cell counts and to improve diagnosis and care of patients coinfected with tuberculosis (TB). We sought to determine associated treatment outcomes. METHODS: Routinely collected data for all patients who initiated ART from 2005 to 2009 were analysed. Median baseline CD4 cell counts by year of ART initiation were compared using the Cuzick test for trend. Mortality and TB incidence rates in the first year of ART were computed. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: First-line ART was initiated in 7659 patients; 64% were women, and the mean age was 37 years (standard deviation 9 years). Median baseline CD4 counts increased from 2005 to 2009 [82 cells/muL (interquartile range (IQR) 24, 153) to 148 cells/muL (IQR 61, 197), respectively; P<0.001]. The mortality rate fell from 6.5/100 person-years at risk (PYAR) [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.5-7.6 PYAR] to 3.6/100 PYAR (95% CI 2.2-5.8 PYAR). TB incidence rates increased from 8.2/100 PYAR (95% CI 7.1-9.5 PYAR) to 15.6/100 PYAR (95% CI 12.4-19.7 PYAR). A later year of ART initiation was independently associated with decreased mortality (HR 0.91; 95% CI 0.83-1.00; P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Baseline CD4 cell counts have increased over time and are associated with decreased mortality. Additional reductions in mortality might be a result of a better standard of care and increased TB case finding. Further efforts to initiate ART earlier should be prioritized even in a setting of capped or reduced funding for ART programmes.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: The emergence of complex HIV-1 drug resistance mutations has been linked to the duration of time patients are on a failing antiretroviral drug regimen. This study reports on resistance profiles in a closely monitored subtype C infected cohort. METHODS: A total of 812 participants were enrolled into the CIPRA-SA 'safeguard the household' study, viral loads were determined at 12-weekly intervals for 96 weeks. Virological failure was defined as either a <1.5 log decrease in viral load at week 12 or two consecutive viral load measurements of >1,000 RNA copies/ml after week 24. Regimens prescribed were in line with the South African roll-out programme (stavudine, lamivudine, efavirenz or nevirapine). Viral RNA was extracted from patients with virological failure, and pol reverse-transcriptase PCR and sequence analysis were performed to determine drug-resistant mutations. RESULTS: Virological failure was observed in 83 participants on the first-line regimen during the study period, of which 61 (73%) had HIV-1 drug-resistant mutations. The M184V mutation was the most frequent (n=46; 65%), followed by K103N (46%) and Y181C (21%). Thymidine analogue mutations were infrequent (1%) and Q151M was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistance profiles were less complex than has been previously reported in South Africa using the same antiretroviral drug regimens. These data suggest that frequent viral load monitoring limits the level and complexity of resistance observed in HIV-1 subtype C, preserving susceptibility to second-line options.</td>

      <td>Psychosocial dysfunction in older children and adolescents is common and may lead to nonadherence to HIV treatments. Poor adherence leads to HIV treatment failure and the development of resistant virus. In resource-limited settings where treatment options are typically limited to only one or two available lines of therapy, identification of individuals at highest risk of failure before failure occurs is of critical importance. Rapid screening tools for psychosocial dysfunction may allow for identification of those children and adolescents who are most likely to benefit from limited psychosocial support services targeted at preventing HIV treatment failure. The Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC) is used in high resource settings for rapid identification of at-risk youth. In 692 HIV-infected treated children (ages of 8-< 17 years) in Botswana, having a high score on the PSC was associated with having virologic failure (OR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.6). The PSC may be a useful screening tool in pediatric HIV.</td>

      <td>Prevalence of paediatric HIV infection in Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Various studies in sub-Saharan Africa have documented high prevalence of HIV infection in children. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and outcome of paediatric HIV/AIDS in a new Teaching Hospital in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, Nigeria. METHODS: A two year retrospective review of patients attending paediatric outpatient unit of the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada, was undertaken for the above objective. RESULTS: Out of a total of 3,669 paediatric patients seen in unit of the hospital, 437(11.9%) tested positive for HIV, 234 were males, while 203 were females (m:f = 1.15:1). Children under the age of five years accounted for 81.7% of the HIV positive children, and mother-to-child transmission was the major route of transmission of HIV in 73.7% of cases. Two other common routes of transmission were the use of blood/ hair dressing implements in 4.8% each, and use of non sterile needle in 3.9%. Most mothers of HIV children were either housewives (45.3%), or petty traders (10.4%), while their fathers were either civil servants (26.5%) or long distance drivers (19.7%). A mortality rate of 3.4% was recorded while 6.0% were lost to follow up. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in children is high in the FCT, Abuja, most of which was through mother-to-child transmission. There is an urgent need to scale up PMTCT programmes to many tertiary, secondary and primary health care facilities across the FCT, and the nation at large in view of the enormous burden of the disease in children. Safe blood for African initiative/techniques should be extended to many health care facilities nationwide, and use of unsterile needles by patent medicine dealers to be prohibited.</td>

      <td>Treatment outcomes in HIV-infected adolescents attending a community-based antiretroviral therapy clinic in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Very few data are available on treatment outcomes of adolescents living with HIV infection (whether perinatally acquired or sexually acquired) in sub-Saharan Africa. The present study therefore compared the treatment outcomes in adolescents with those of young adults at a public sector community-based ART programme in Cape Town, South Africa. METHODS: Treatment outcomes of adolescents (9-19 years) were compared with those of young adults (20-28 years), enrolled in a prospective cohort between September 2002 and June 2009. Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess outcomes and determine associations with age, while adjusting for potential confounders. The treatment outcomes were mortality, loss to follow-up (LTFU), immunological response, virological suppression and virological failure. RESULTS: 883 patients, including 65 adolescents (47 perinatally infected and 17 sexually infected) and 818 young adults, received ART. There was no difference in median baseline CD4 cell count between adolescents and young adults (133.5 vs 116 cells/muL; p = 0.31). Overall mortality rates in adolescents and young adults were 1.2 (0.3-4.8) and 3.1 (2.4-3.9) deaths per 100 person-years, respectively. Adolescents had lower rates of virological suppression (< 400 copies/mL) at 48 weeks (27.3% vs 63.1%; p < 0.001). Despite this, however, the median change in CD4 count from baseline at 48 weeks of ART was significantly greater for adolescents than young adults (373 vs 187 cells/muL; p = 0.0001). Treatment failure rates were 8.2 (4.6-14.4) and 5.0 (4.1-6.1) per 100 person-years in the two groups. In multivariate analyses, there was no significant difference in LTFU and mortality between age groups but increased risk in virological failure [AHR 2.06 (95% CI 1.11-3.81; p = 0.002)] in adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Despite lower virological suppression rates and higher rates of virological failure, immunological responses were nevertheless greater in adolescents than young adults whereas rates of mortality and LTFU were similar. Further studies to determine the reasons for poorer virological outcomes are needed.</td>

      <td>Eliminating of paediatric HIV within prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) interventions rests on complete follow-up of all children. We report on predictors of child attrition in the PMTCT cascade over 5 years where 1050 pregnant women were enrolled at 36 gestational weeks. Mother and child pairs were followed up at birth, 6 weeks, 4 months, 9 months, and every 6 months thereafter for 60 months. Higher attrition was observed for children of economically advantaged, socially stable mothers regardless of HIV status, whereas compliance was observed for children whose mothers tested positive for HIV-1, HSV-2 and Syphilis. Low birthweight was associated with attrition regardless of maternal HIV status. Five years predictors of attrition did not differ by maternal HIV status, as HIV-exposed children succumbed to mortality and those not exposed were loss to follow-up (LFU). Child follow-up is influenced more by maternal lifestyle and health risks leading to retention of high-risk children in PMTCT programmes.</td>

      <td>HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance (TDR) could reverse the gains of antiretroviral rollout. To ensure that current first-line therapies remain effective, TDR levels in recently infected treatment-naive patients need to be monitored. A literature review and data mining exercise was carried out to determine the temporal trends in TDR in South Africa. In addition, 72 sequences from seroconvertors identified from Africa Centre's 2010 HIV surveillance round were also examined for TDR. Publicly available data on TDR were retrieved from GenBank, curated in RegaDB, and analyzed using the Calibrated Population Resistance Program. There was no evidence of TDR from the 2010 rural KwaZulu Natal samples. Ten datasets with a total of 1618 sequences collected between 2000 and 2010 were pooled to provide a temporal analysis of TDR. The year with the highest TDR rate was 2002 [6.67%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.09-13.79%; n=6/90]. After 2002, TDR levels returned to <5% (WHO low-level threshold) and showed no statistically significant increase in the interval between 2002 and 2010. The most common mutations were associated with NNRTI resistance, K103N, followed by Y181C and Y188C/L. Five sequences had multiple resistance mutations associated with NNRTI resistance. There is no evidence of TDR in rural KwaZulu-Natal. TDR levels in South Africa have remained low following a downward trend since 2003. Continuous vigilance in monitoring of TDR is needed as more patients are initiated and maintained onto antiretroviral therapy.</td>

      <td>Resistance patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Nairobi.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: In Kenya, which ranks thirteenth of 27 high tuberculosis burden countries, diagnosis is based on Ziehl-Neelsen staining alone and patients are treated without information on sensitivity patterns. This study aimed to determine resistance patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from pulmonary samples. METHODOLOGY: Pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Nairobi were randomly sampled after informed consent and recruited into the study using a structured questionnaire. Specimens were cultured in liquid and solid media, and drug susceptibility tests were performed for first-line drugs including (isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide). RESULTS: Eighty-six (30%) of 286 isolates were resistant to at least one of five antibiotics tested. Thirty-seven (30.2%) isolates were resistant to isoniazid; 15 (11.6%) to streptomycin; 13 (4.5%) to ethambutol; four (1.4%) to rifampin ; and 30 (10.4%) to pyrazinamide. Double resistance was seen as follows: four (1.4%) isolates were resistant to both isoniazid and pyrazinamide; four (1.4%) to streptomycin and isoniazid; and one (0.3%) to rifampin and streptomycin. Two isolates (0.7%) were multidrug resistant, and one was triple resistant with an additional resistance to ethambutol. Results also showed 88.7% of patients were below the age of 40 years, while 26.3% were HIV positive. The majority of the patients (66.5%) were unemployed or self-employed in small businesses, with 79.4% earning less than 100 USD per month. CONCLUSION: The high resistance observed in isoniazid, which is a first-line drug, could result in an increase in multidrug resistance unless control programs are strengthened. Poverty should be addressed to reduce infection rates.</td>

      <td>Task shifting to community health workers (CHW) has received recognition. We examined the performance of community antiretroviral therapy and tuberculosis treatment supporters (CATTS) in scaling up antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Reach Out, a community-based ART program in Uganda. Retrospective data on home visits made by CATTS were analyzed to examine the CATTS ability to perform home visits to patients based on the model's standard procedures. Qualitative interviews conducted with 347 randomly selected patients and 47 CATTS explored their satisfaction with the model. The CATTS ability to follow-up with patients worsened from patients requiring daily, weekly, monthly, to three-monthly home visits. Only 26% and 15% of them correctly home visited patients with drug side effects and a missed clinic appointment, respectively. Additionally, 83% visited stable pre-ART and ART patients (96%) more frequently than required. Six hundred eighty of the 3650 (18%) patients were lost to follow-up (LTFU) during the study period. The mean number of patients LTFU per CATTS was 40.5. Male (p = 0.005), worked for longer durations (p = 0.02), and had lower education (p = 0.005). An increased number of patients (p = 0.01) were associated with increased LTFU. Ninety-two percent of the CATTS felt the model could be improved by reducing the workload. CATTS who were HIV positive, female, not residing in the same village as their patients, more educated, married, on ART, and spent less time with the patients were rated better by their patients. The Reach-Out CHW model is labor-intensive. Triaged home visits could improve performance and allow CATTS time to focus on patients requiring more intensive follow-up.</td>

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Studies published in English between January 1996 and December 2010 were searched in Medline and EMBASE. Three independent reviewers examined studies of mortality within one year post-ART. An article was included if the study was conducted in a LMIC, participants were initiating ART in a non-clinical trial setting and were >/=15 years. Fifty studies were included; 38 (76%) from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), 5 (10%) from Asia, 2 (4%) from the Americas, and 5 (10%) were multi-regional. Median follow-up time and pre-ART CD4 cell count ranged from 3-55 months and 11-192 cells/mm(3), respectively. Loss-to-follow-up, reported in 40 (80%) studies, ranged from 0.3%-27%. Overall, SSA had the highest pooled 12-month mortality probability of 0.17 (95% CI 0.11-0.24) versus 0.11 (95% CI 0.10-0.13) for Asia, and 0.07 (95% CI 0.007-0.20) for the Americas. Of 14 (28%) studies reporting cause-specific mortality, tuberculosis (TB) (5%-44%), wasting (5%-53%), advanced HIV (20%-37%), and chronic diarrhea (10%-25%) were most common. Independent factors associated with early mortality in 30 (60%) studies included: low baseline CD4 cell count, male sex, advanced World Health Organization clinical stage, low body mass index, anemia, age greater than 40 years, and pre-ART quantitative HIV RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Significant heterogeneity in outcomes and in methods of reporting outcomes exist among published studies evaluating mortality in the first year after ART initiation in LMIC. Early mortality rates are highest in SSA, and opportunistic illnesses such as TB and wasting syndrome are the most common reported causes of death. Strategies addressing modifiable risk factors associated with early death are urgently needed.</td>

      <td>Estimating loss to follow-up in HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy: the effect of the competing risk of death in Zambia and Switzerland.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Loss to follow-up (LTFU) is common in antiretroviral therapy (ART) programmes. Mortality is a competing risk (CR) for LTFU; however, it is often overlooked in cohort analyses. We examined how the CR of death affected LTFU estimates in Zambia and Switzerland. METHODS AND FINDINGS: HIV-infected patients aged >/=18 years who started ART 2004-2008 in observational cohorts in Zambia and Switzerland were included. We compared standard Kaplan-Meier curves with CR cumulative incidence. We calculated hazard ratios for LTFU across CD4 cell count strata using cause-specific Cox models, or Fine and Gray subdistribution models, adjusting for age, gender, body mass index and clinical stage. 89,339 patients from Zambia and 1,860 patients from Switzerland were included. 12,237 patients (13.7%) in Zambia and 129 patients (6.9%) in Switzerland were LTFU and 8,498 (9.5%) and 29 patients (1.6%), respectively, died. In Zambia, the probability of LTFU was overestimated in Kaplan-Meier curves: estimates at 3.5 years were 29.3% for patients starting ART with CD4 cells <100 cells/microl and 15.4% among patients starting with >/= 350 cells/microL. The estimates from CR cumulative incidence were 22.9% and 13.6%, respectively. Little difference was found between naive and CR analyses in Switzerland since only few patients died. The results from Cox and Fine and Gray models were similar: in Zambia the risk of loss to follow-up and death increased with decreasing CD4 counts at the start of ART, whereas in Switzerland there was a trend in the opposite direction, with patients with higher CD4 cell counts more likely to be lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In ART programmes in low-income settings the competing risk of death can substantially bias standard analyses of LTFU. The CD4 cell count and other prognostic factors may be differentially associated with LTFU in low-income and high-income settings.</td>

      <td>Re-treatment tuberculosis cases categorised as "other": are they properly managed?</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Although the World Health Organization (WHO) provides information on the number of TB patients categorised as "other", there is limited information on treatment regimens or treatment outcomes for "other". Such information is important, as inappropriate treatment can lead to patients remaining infectious and becoming a potential source of drug resistance. Therefore, using a cohort of TB patients from a large registration centre in Lilongwe, Malawi, our study determined the proportion of all TB re-treatment patients who were registered as "other", and described their characteristics and treatment outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective observational study used routine program data to determine the proportion of all TB re-treatment patients who were registered as "other" and describe their characteristics and treatment outcomes between January 2006 and December 2008. RESULTS: 1,384 (12%) of 11,663 TB cases were registered as re-treatment cases. Of these, 898 (65%) were categorised as "other": 707 (79%) had sputum smear-negative pulmonary TB and 191 (21%) had extra pulmonary TB. Compared to the smear-positive relapse, re-treatment after default (RAD) and failure cases, smear-negative "other" cases were older than 34 years and less likely to have their HIV status ascertained. Among those with known HIV status, "other" TB cases were more likely to be HIV positive. Of TB patients categorised as "other", 462 (51%) were managed on the first-line regimen with a treatment success rate of 63%. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of re-treatment patients were categorised as "other". Many of these patients were HIV-infected and over half were treated with a first-line regimen, contrary to national guidelines. Treatment success was low. More attention to recording, diagnosis and management of these patients is warranted as incorrect treatment regimen and poor outcomes could lead to the development of drug resistant forms of TB.</td>

      <td>Excellent clinical outcomes and high retention in care among adults in a community-based HIV treatment program in rural Rwanda.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has rapidly expanded; as of the end of 2010, an estimated 6.6 million people are receiving ART in low-income and middle-income countries. Few reports have focused on the experiences of rural health centers or the use of community health workers. We report clinical and programatic outcomes at 24 months for a cohort of patients enrolled in a community-based ART program in southeastern Rwanda under collaboration between Partners In Health and the Rwandan Ministry of Health. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A retrospective medical record review was performed for a cohort of 1041 HIV+ adult patients initiating community-based ART between June 1, 2005, and April 30, 2006. Key programatic elements included free ART with direct observation by community health worker, tuberculosis screening and treatment, nutritional support, a transportation allowance, and social support. Among 1041 patients who initiated community-based ART, 961 (92.3%) were retained in care, 52 (5%) died and 28 (2.7%) were lost to follow-up. Median CD4 T-cell count increase was 336 cells per microliter [interquartile range: (IQR): 212-493] from median 190 cells per microliter (IQR: 116-270) at initiation. CONCLUSIONS: A program of intensive community-based treatment support for ART in rural Rwanda had excellent outcomes in 24-month retention in care. Having committed to improving access to HIV treatment in sub-Saharan Africa, the international community, including country HIV programs, should set high programmatic outcome benchmarks.</td>

      <td>Among HIV-infected adults attending non-governmental organization voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) sites in Uganda that provide a nine-month course of isoniazid preventive treatment (IPT), we report on loss to follow-up (LTFU) and its associated risk factors. The design was a retrospective cohort study of program data spanning a three year period (2006-2008). A total of 586 IPT patients were enrolled of whom 335 (57.1%) were females with a mean age of 34 years. Of those starting IPT, 341 (58.1%) were lost to follow-up, 197 (33.6%) completed IPT, 29 (4.9%) were discontinued and 19 (3.2%) died. The return rates at one, three, five and seven months were 78.0% (457), 62.1% (364), 52.9% (310) and 33.6% (197) respectively. Being less than 30 years of age, widowed, separated, or divorced were found to be associated with a higher risk of loss to follow-up. Sudden improvement in retention on IPT was observed between the years 2006 and 2007, although causes of the improvement are poorly understood hence the need for more research. At non-governmental VCT sites in Uganda, six out of ten individuals enrolled on IPT are lost to follow-up and efforts to reduce this attrition including systems strengthening might play a critical role in the success of IPT programs.</td>

      <td>Economics of switching to second-line antiretroviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir in Africa: estimates based on DART trial results and costs for Uganda and Kenya.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Substantial immunological improvement has been reported for HIV-infected patients who switch from a failing regimen to a protease inhibitor regimen with Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). We use decision analysis modeling to estimate health and economic consequences expected from this switch. METHODS: A Markov model combined best evidence for CD4(+) T-cell response, infectious disease events, death rates, and quality of life for African populations with Kenyan and Ugandan data on drug and medical care costs. We estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of switching to an LPV/r-based regimen versus remaining on a failed first antiretroviral (ARV) regimen or discontinuing all ARV drugs. The model assumes concurrent use of cotrimoxazole, and 4% annual loss to follow-up. Local effects due to prevalence of malaria and tuberculosis are included in the model. Sensitivity analysis examines the effects of varying disease, ARV therapy and CD4(+) T-cell cost, and ART discontinuation assumptions. RESULTS: The base model estimates an improvement of 20 months in average survival for the LPV/r group. The respective LPV/r ICER for Kenya is $1483 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) compared to $1673/QALY for Uganda. The ICERs increase to $1517 and $1707, respectively, if CD4(+) T-cell tests cost $25. The model comparing switching to LPV/r to discontinuing all ARV drugs decreases both costs and benefits proportionally for the treatment groups. CONCLUSION: The estimates are clearly below the most stringent World Health Organization benchmark for cost-effectiveness for Kenya and within the acceptable range of cost-effectiveness for Uganda. Thus, the switch to second-line therapy with LPV/r in these countries appears to be a cost-effective use of resources.</td>

      <td>Lipid profiles in young HIV-infected children initiating and changing antiretroviral therapy.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Both HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy are associated with dyslipidemias in adults, but there are fewer data on outcomes in young children. Here we examined lipid profile changes in a cohort of young children before and after suppression on an initial ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r)-based regimen and after switch to a nevirapine (NVP)-based regimen. METHODS: One hundred ninety-five HIV-infected children who initiated LPV/r-based therapy when <24 months of age at 1 site in Johannesburg, South Africa, and who achieved viral suppression (<400 copies/mL sustained for >/= 3 months) were randomized to either continue on the LPV/r-based regimen (n = 99) or to switch to a NVP-based regimen (n = 96). Nonfasting concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides (TG) were measured pretreatment, at randomization when suppressed, and at 9, 20, and 31 months postrandomization. RESULTS: Median age at treatment initiation was 9 months, and the initial regimen was maintained for an average of 9 months before randomization. TC, low-density lipoprotein, and HDL increased from pretreatment to randomization (P < 0.0001) and TC/HDL ratio and TG decreased (P < 0.0001). After switching to NVP, HDL was significantly higher (P < 0.02) and TC/HDL and TG significantly lower (P < 0.0001) through 31 months postswitch relative to remaining on the LPV/r-based regimen. CONCLUSION: Initiating antiretroviral therapy was associated with changes to a more favorable lipid profile in young children. Switching from a LPV/r-based regimen to a NVP-based regimen accentuated and continued these improvements. Investigation of safe and effective methods for managing dyslipidemias in children of different ages in resource-limited settings is warranted.</td>

      <td>Similar mortality and reduced loss to follow-up in integrated compared with vertical programs providing antiretroviral treatment in sub-saharan Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Vertical HIV programs have achieved good results but may not be feasible or appropriate in many resource-limited settings. Medecins sans Frontieres has treated HIV in vertical programs since 2000 and over time integrated HIV treatment into general health care services using simplified protocols. We analyzed the survival probability among patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) from 2003 to 2010 in integrated versus vertical programs in 9 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Cox regression assessed mortality and program design association, adjusting for baseline age, body mass index, clinical WHO stage, tuberculosis, program age and setting. The analysis included 15,403 HIV-positive adults on ART in 7 vertical (14,124 patients) and 10 integrated (1279 patients) programs. Cox regression including 14,523 patients followed for up to 30 months ART showed similar outcomes for mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83 to 1.24) and lower risk of loss to follow-up (aHR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.83) in integrated compared with vertical programs. The greatest risk of death was from initiating ART at WHO stage 4 (aHR 1.99, 95% CI: 1.74 to 2.29), although greater program experience was protective (aHR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.89). Risk of loss to follow-up was greater in experienced programs (aHR: 3.33; 95% CI: 2.92 to 3.79) and rural settings (aHR: 3.82; 95% CI: 3.49 to 4.20). CONCLUSIONS: ART delivery in integrated general health care programs results in good outcomes. Compared with vertical HIV programs, patients initiated ART in integrated programs at more advanced stages of clinical immunosuppression yet had similar risk of death and lower risk of loss to follow-up.</td>

      <td>SETTING: Tuberculosis (TB) treatment center at Coast Provincial General Hospital in Mombasa, Kenya. OBJECTIVES: To describe TB management practices in a facility in coastal Kenya and identify factors associated with poor treatment outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective review of patient treatment records from January 2008 to June 2009. Treatment outcomes of patients were classified as treatment success (cure or treatment completion) or poor treatment outcome (treatment failure, death or default). Relative risk regression was used to determine the association between exposures of interest and poor treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Records were obtained from a total of 183 patients: 142 (78%) had pulmonary TB, 68 (37%) were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected and 81 (44%) had acid-fast bacilli (AFB) positive smear micros- copy. Most treated individuals (86%) achieved a successful treatment outcome as defined by the World Health Organization. Of those with poor treatment outcomes, 64% defaulted, 32% died, and 4% failed treatment. Initial negative AFB smear and HIV co-infection were associated with poor treatment outcomes (RR 3.32, 95%CI 1.22-8.99 and RR 4.61, 95%CI 1.69- 12.59, respectively). CONCLUSION: Strategies to accelerate accurate diagnosis of smear-negative TB and increase patient retention during treatment, especially in HIV co-infected individuals, are needed to reduce poor treatment outcomes in Kenya.</td>

      <td>Outcomes of reintroducing anti-tuberculosis drugs following cutaneous adverse drug reactions.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Data regarding outcomes of tuberculosis (TB) associated cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR) are limited. The re-introduction of first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs after CADR is controversial and management poorly defined. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 298 patients with CADR admitted to a tertiary dermatology ward in Cape Town, South Africa. RESULTS: TB-associated CADR was diagnosed in 65 of 298 patients. Of these, 60/65 (92%) were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected (median CD4 count 107 cells/mm (3)). Anti-tuberculosis drugs were reintroduced in 46/65 (71%) patients, of whom 23/46 (50%) developed re-introduction reactions. The most frequent re-introduction reactions were itch in 11/23 (48%) and hepatitis in 9/23 (39%) patients. Of the 23 re-introduction reactions, 13 (57%) were mild, six (26%) moderate and four (26%) severe. Among those with reintroduction reactions, rifampicin (RMP) was the offending drug in 13/23 (57%), isoniazid in 5/23(22%), pyrazinamide in 3/23 (13%), and ethambutol, streptomycin and ofloxacin each in 1/23 (4%) cases. Lack of previous TB treatment and re-challenge with RMP were independently associated with the likelihood of reintroduction reactions. CONCLUSIONS: In this high TB burden setting, although re-introduction reactions are common, the majority are non-life-threatening. All first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs can cause CADR, and RMP is more commonly implicated than previously reported. These data guide the management of anti-tuberculosis drug-associated CADR in high HIV prevalence settings.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: Data from observational cohorts may be influenced by population structure and loss to follow-up (LTFU). Quality of care may be associated with participation in cohort networks. We aimed to study the participation, characteristics and retention rates of immigrants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS). METHODS: We compared enrolment over time (1996-1999, 2000-2003 and 2004-2008) and LTFU between individuals from different geographical regions. In 2008, we performed a cross-sectional survey to investigate the proportion of individuals not participating in the SHCS but who were in care at SHCS institutions. Predictors for LTFU were analysed using Cox proportional hazard models, and those for nonparticipation using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 7840 individuals entered the SHCS during the observation period. The proportion of immigrants increased over time, especially the proportion of women from sub-Saharan Africa, which increased from 21 to 48% during the observation period. Overall LTFU was 3.76 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.58-3.95]/100, with the highest hazard ratio in men from sub-Saharan Africa (2.82/100 patient-years; 95% CI 2.30-3.46/100), compared with men from northwestern countries. Other predictors for LTFU were age <30 years, lower education, injecting drug use, and higher baseline CD4 cell counts. Participants taking antiretroviral therapy had reduced LTFU. The survey showed that 84% of HIV-infected patients in care at SHCS institutions were enrolled in the cohort. Nonparticipation was more likely among men from non-European regions (odds ratio 2.73; 95% CI 2.29-3.24), women from sub-Saharan Africa (odds ratio 3.01; 95% CI 2.40-3.77) and women from Latin America/Caribbean (odds ratio 2.10; 95% CI 1.30-3.39). CONCLUSIONS: Numbers of HIV-infected immigrants are increasing but they are underrepresented in the SHCS, and immigrants are more likely to be lost to follow-up.</td>

      <td>Roll-out of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in South Africa should impact on AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Government provision began in 2003, with 23% coverage for World Health Organization (WHO) stage IV AIDS in 2006. To assess the effect of cART availability on KS management, we evaluated records from 701 KS patients seen at a tertiary oncology centre in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, from 1995 to 2006. Associations between cART use and measures of KS care were evaluated. cART availability was 0% prior to 2001, 9.6% (2001-2003) and 44% (2004-2006). Documentation of HIV status increased incrementally from 65% to 92%. cART was associated with chemotherapy administration: 56% on cART versus 17% not on cART (P < 0.001); and less loss to follow-up, 13% on cART versus 38% not on cART (P < 0.001). cART availability improves the care of AIDS-associated KS. Further increases in cART availability for this population are needed in South Africa.</td>

      <td>It is time to consider third-line options in antiretroviral-experienced paediatric patients?</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The historic use of full-dose ritonavir as part of an unboosted protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral therapy regimen in some South African children contributes to the frequent accumulation of major PI resistance mutations. METHODS: In order to describe the prevalence of major PI resistance in children failing antiretroviral therapy and to investigate the clinical, immunological and virological outcomes in children with PI resistance, we conducted a cross-sectional study, with a nested case series, following up those children with major PI resistance. The setting was public health sector antiretroviral clinics in the Western Cape province of South Africa, and the subjects were children failing antiretroviral therapy. The following outcome measures were investigated: CD4 count, viral load and resistance mutations. RESULTS: Fourteen (17%) of 82 patients, referred from tertiary hospitals, had major PI resistance. All these patients were exposed to regimens that included ritonavir as a single PI. Immune reconstitution and clinical benefit were achieved when using a lopinavir/ritonavir-based treatment regimen in these children with prior PI resistance. At first HIV-1 viral load follow up after initial resistance testing (n = 11), only one patient had a viral load of less than 400 copies/ml; at a subsequent follow up (n = 9), the viral loads of five patients were less than 400 copies/ml. Patients retained on LPV/r had lower viral loads than those switched to a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). However, two of three patients with follow-up resistance tests accumulated additional PI resistance. CONCLUSIONS: In children with pre-existing PI resistance, although initially effective, the long-term durability of a lopinavir/ritonavir-based treatment regimen can be compromised by the accumulation of resistance mutations. Furthermore, a second-line NNRTI regimen is often not durable in these patients. As genotypic resistance testing and third-line treatment regimens are costly and limited in availability, we propose eligibility criteria to identify patients with high risk for resistance and guidance on drug selection for children who would benefit from third-line therapy.</td>

      <td>Male gender predicts mortality in a large cohort of patients receiving antiretroviral therapy in Uganda.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Because men in Africa are less likely to access HIV/AIDS care than women, we aimed to determine if men have differing outcomes from women across a nationally representative sample of adult patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy in Uganda. METHODS: We estimated survival distributions for adult male and female patients using Kaplan-Meier, and constructed multivariable regressions to model associations of baseline variables with mortality. We assessed person-years of life lost up to age 55 by sex. To minimize the impact of patient attrition, we assumed a weighted 30% mortality rate among those lost to follow up. RESULTS: We included data from 22,315 adults receiving antiretroviral therapy. At baseline, men tended to be older, had lower CD4 baseline values, more advanced disease, had pulmonary tuberculosis and had received less treatment follow up (all at p < 0.001). Loss to follow up differed between men and women (7.5 versus 5.9%, p < 0.001). Over the period of study, men had a significantly increased risk of death compared with female patients (adjusted hazard ratio 1.43, 95% CI 1.31-1.57, p < 0.001). The crude mortality rate for males differed importantly from females (43.9, 95% CI 40.7-47.0/1000 person-years versus 26.9, 95% CI 25.4-28.5/1000 person years, p < 0.001). The probability of survival was 91.2% among males and 94.1% among females at 12 months. Person-years of life lost was lower for females than males (689.7 versus 995.9 per 1000 person-years, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In order to maximize the benefits of antiretroviral therapy, treatment programmes need to be gender sensitive to the specific needs of both women and men. Particular efforts are needed to enroll men earlier into care.</td>

      <td>Practices to improve identification of adult antiretroviral therapy failure at the Lighthouse Trust clinic in Lilongwe, Malawi.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: Evaluating treatment failure is critical when deciding to modify antiretroviral therapy (ART). Virologic Assessment Forms (VAFs) were implemented in July 2008 as a prerequisite for ordering viral load. The form requires assessment of clinical and immunologic status. METHODS: Using the Electronic Medical Record (EMR), we retrospectively evaluated patients who met 2006 WHO guidelines for immunologic failure (>/=15 years old; on ART >/=6 months; CD4 count <baseline OR CD4 count >50% drop from peak OR CD4 persistently <100 cells) at the Lighthouse Trust clinic from December 2007 to December 2009. We compared virologic screening, VAF implementation and ART modification during the same period using Fisher's exact tests and unpaired t-tests as appropriate. RESULTS: Of 7000 enrolled ART patients >/=15 years old with at least two CD4 counts, 10% had immunologic failure with a median follow-up time on ART of 1.4 years (IQR: 0.8-2.3). Forty (6%) viral loads were ordered: 14 (35%) were detectable (>400 HIV RNA copies/mL) and one (7%) patient was switched to second-line therapy. Overall, 259 VAFs were completed: 67% for immunologic failure and 33% for WHO Stage 4 condition. Before VAF implementation, 1% of patients had viral loads drawn during routine care, whereas afterwards, 8% did (P<0.0001; 95% CI: 0.03-0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians did not identify a large proportion of immunologic failure patients for screening. Implementation of VAFs produced little improvement in virologic screening during routine care. Better training and monitoring systems are needed.</td>

      <td>Effect of pretreatment HIV-1 drug resistance on immunological, virological, and drug-resistance outcomes of first-line antiretroviral treatment in sub-Saharan Africa: a multicentre cohort study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The effect of pretreatment HIV-1 drug resistance on the response to first-line combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa has not been assessed. We studied pretreatment drug resistance and virological, immunological, and drug-resistance treatment outcomes in a large prospective cohort. METHODS: HIV-1 infected patients in the PharmAccess African Studies to Evaluate Resistance Monitoring (PASER-M) cohort started non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART at 13 clinical sites in six countries, from 2007 to 2009. We used the International Antiviral Society-USA drug resistance mutation list and the Stanford algorithm to classify participants into three pretreatment drug resistance categories: no pretreatment drug resistance, pretreatment drug resistance with fully active ART prescribed, or pretreatment drug resistance with reduced susceptibility to at least one prescribed drug. We assessed risk factors of virological failure (>/=400 copies per mL) and acquired drug resistance after 12 months of ART by use of multilevel logistic regression with multiple imputations for missing data. CD4 cell count increase was estimated with linear mixed models. FINDINGS: Pretreatment drug resistance results were available for 2579 (94%) of 2733 participants; 2404 (93%) had no pretreatment drug resistance, 123 (5%) had pretreatment drug resistance to at least one prescribed drug, and 52 (2%) had pretreatment drug resistance and received fully active ART. Compared with participants without pretreatment drug resistance, the odds ratio (OR) for virological failure (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.44-3.14; p<0.0001) and acquired drug-resistance (2.30, 1.55-3.40; p<0.0001) was increased in participants with pretreatment drug resistance to at least one prescribed drug, but not in those with pretreatment drug resistance and fully active ART. CD4 count increased less in participants with pretreatment drug resistance than in those without (35 cells per muL difference after 12 months; 95% CI 13-58; p=0.002). INTERPRETATION: At least three fully active antiretroviral drugs are needed to ensure an optimum response to first-line regimens and to prevent acquisition of drug resistance. Improved access to alternative combinations of antiretroviral drugs in sub-Saharan Africa is warranted. FUNDING: The Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</td>

      <td>Problem-solving therapy for depression and common mental disorders in Zimbabwe: piloting a task-shifting primary mental health care intervention in a population with a high prevalence of people living with HIV.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence that interventions for depression and other common mental disorders (CMD) can be integrated sustainably into primary health care in Africa. We aimed to pilot a low-cost multi-component 'Friendship Bench Intervention' for CMD, locally adapted from problem-solving therapy and delivered by trained and supervised female lay workers to learn if was feasible and possibly effective as well as how best to implement it on a larger scale. METHOD: We trained lay workers for 8 days in screening and monitoring CMD and in delivering the intervention. Ten lay workers screened consecutive adult attenders who either were referred or self-referred to the Friendship Bench between July and December 2007. Those scoring above the validated cut-point of the Shona Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ) for CMD were potentially eligible. Exclusions were suicide risk or very severe depression. All others were offered 6 sessions of problem-solving therapy (PST) enhanced with a component of activity scheduling. Weekly nurse-led group supervision and monthly supervision from a mental health specialist were provided. Data on SSQ scores at 6 weeks after entering the study were collected by an independent research nurse. Lay workers completed a brief evaluation on their experiences of delivering the intervention. RESULTS: Of 395 potentially eligible, 33 (8%) were excluded due to high risk. Of the 362 left, 2% (7) declined and 10% (35) were lost to follow-up leaving an 88% response rate (n = 320). Over half (n = 166, 52%) had presented with an HIV-related problem. Mean SSQ score fell from 11.3 (sd 1.4) before treatment to 6.5 (sd 2.4) after 3-6 sessions. The drop in SSQ scores was proportional to the number of sessions attended. Nine of the ten lay workers rated themselves as very able to deliver the PST intervention. CONCLUSION: We have found preliminary evidence of a clinically meaningful improvement in CMD associated with locally adapted problem-solving therapy delivered by lay health workers through routine primary health care in an African setting. There is a need to test the effectiveness of this task-shifting mental health intervention in an appropriately powered randomised controlled trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN: ISRCTN25476759.</td>

      <td>Loss to follow-up and mortality among HIV-infected people co-infected with TB at ART initiation in Durban, South Africa.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of tuberculosis (TB) co-infection on death and loss to follow-up (LTFU) 12 months after entry into an ART program. DESIGN: Prospective intervention study. METHODS: From May 2007 to 2008, patients undergoing pre-ART training in Durban, South Africa, were screened for pulmonary TB using mycobacterial culture. Subjects missing appointments for >3 months were phoned. Patients who could not be reached were considered LTFU. Deaths were ascertained by report from family members. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate time to LTFU or death for 3 groups at enrollment as follows: (1) newly diagnosed with TB by sputum culture; (2) on TB treatment (ie, previously diagnosed); and (3) TB free. We evaluated the role of TB on mortality and LTFU using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Nine hundred fifty-one HIV-infected subjects were enrolled; 59% were female, and median baseline CD4 count was 90 cells per microliter (IQR: 41-148 cells/muL). One hundred forty-four (15%) were newly diagnosed with TB by sputum culture; an additional 199 (21%) were already on TB treatment. By 12 months, 26% newly diagnosed with TB at enrollment died or were LTFU, compared with 19% already on TB treatment, and 14% who were TB free (P = 0.001). Controlling for age, sex, smoking, CD4, and opportunistic infection history, subjects newly diagnosed with pulmonary TB were 76% more likely to die or be LTFU (hazard ratio: 1.76, 95% confidence interval: 1.20 to 2.60) than those without TB. CONCLUSIONS: HIV/TB co-infected individuals are more likely to die or be LTFU within 12 months of ART clinic entry in South Africa. These patients require intensive follow-up during ART initiation.</td>

      <td>Long-term impact of the Kenya postelection crisis on clinic attendance and medication adherence for HIV-infected children in western Kenya.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Kenya experienced a political and humanitarian crisis after presidential elections on December 27, 2007. We sought to describe both the immediate and long-term impact of this conflict for HIV-infected children in western Kenya. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of a cohort of these children for 3 periods: period 1, before the election (October 26, 2007, to December 25, 2007); period 2, immediately after the election (December 26, 2007, to April 15, 2008); and period 3, long-term postelection (April 16, 2008, to December 31, 2008). Two outcome variables of loss-to-follow-up (LTFU) were assessed: initial LTFU and complete LTFU. We assessed clinic adherence by evaluating the difference between actual visits and expected visits. Among children on antiretroviral therapy (ART), we assessed overall medication adherence and changes in medication adherence. RESULTS: Two thousand five hundred forty-nine HIV-infected children <14 years were seen in period 1. Children on ART had less initial LTFU (3.0% compared with 5.1%, P < 0.01) and less complete LTFU (2.6% compared with 6.8%, P < 0.001) than children not on ART. For children not on ART, clinic adherence improved in period 3 compared with period 2. For children on ART with a more strict measure of clinic adherence, clinic adherence declined over time. Orphans had better clinic adherence than nonorphans. Among children on ART, there were few demographic differences when comparing medication adherence between time. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected children are at risk for disruptions in clinic follow-up and medication adherence after a humanitarian crisis. Individual and contextual factors moderate the effects of these disruptions.</td>

      <td>Integration of antiretroviral therapy with tuberculosis treatment.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: We previously reported that integrating antiretroviral therapy (ART) with tuberculosis treatment reduces mortality. However, the timing for the initiation of ART during tuberculosis treatment remains unresolved. METHODS: We conducted a three-group, open-label, randomized, controlled trial in South Africa involving 642 ambulatory patients, all with tuberculosis (confirmed by a positive sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli), human immunodeficiency virus infection, and a CD4+ T-cell count of less than 500 per cubic millimeter. Findings in the earlier-ART group (ART initiated within 4 weeks after the start of tuberculosis treatment, 214 patients) and later-ART group (ART initiated during the first 4 weeks of the continuation phase of tuberculosis treatment, 215 patients) are presented here. RESULTS: At baseline, the median CD4+ T-cell count was 150 per cubic millimeter, and the median viral load was 161,000 copies per milliliter, with no significant differences between the two groups. The incidence rate of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or death was 6.9 cases per 100 person-years in the earlier-ART group (18 cases) as compared with 7.8 per 100 person-years in the later-ART group (19 cases) (incidence-rate ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 1.79; P=0.73). However, among patients with CD4+ T-cell counts of less than 50 per cubic millimeter, the incidence rates of AIDS or death were 8.5 and 26.3 cases per 100 person-years, respectively (incidence-rate ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.07 to 1.13; P=0.06). The incidence rates of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) were 20.1 and 7.7 cases per 100 person-years, respectively (incidence-rate ratio, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.48 to 4.82; P<0.001). Adverse events requiring a switching of antiretroviral drugs occurred in 10 patients in the earlier-ART group and 1 patient in the later-ART group (P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of ART in patients with CD4+ T-cell counts of less than 50 per cubic millimeter increased AIDS-free survival. Deferral of the initiation of ART to the first 4 weeks of the continuation phase of tuberculosis therapy in those with higher CD4+ T-cell counts reduced the risks of IRIS and other adverse events related to ART without increasing the risk of AIDS or death.

      <td>Antiretroviral treatment in the private sector in Namibia.</td>
      <td>Antiretroviral treatment (ART) has been available in the private sector in Namibia since 1998. National guidelines were developed by the Ministry of Health and clinicians of the public and private sector in 2003 and launched at the start of the public sector ART programme by the Ministry of Health. The Namibian HIV Clinicians Society was established around this period to promote adherence to the national guidelines and to provide comprehensive training for health professionals. To monitor adherence to national ART guidelines, in 2003, the Society requested access to anonymized data on ART dispensing from the medical insurance industry. Dispensing data from all Namibian medical insurance companies were obtained. ART regimens were categorized as recommended (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based and boosted protease inhibitor [PI]-based), not recommended (non-boosted PI-based or stavudine/didanosine-containing regimens), ineffective (dual therapy) and second line or salvage regimens. This analysis was repeated in 2004, 2005 and 2008. In 2003, only 2306 adult private patients received ART, of which only 1527 (66%) were recommended regimens. In 2008, 7010 private patients received ART, of which 6372 (91%) were recommended regimens. The private sector covered about 15% of the total number of 46,732 reported ART patients reported in the year 2008. Many of these private patients might not have accessed ART in the public sector.</td>

      <td>Outcomes of stable HIV-positive patients down-referred from a doctor-managed antiretroviral therapy clinic to a nurse-managed primary health clinic for monitoring and treatment.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical, immunologic and virologic outcomes among stable HIV-positive patients down-referred to a nurse-managed primary healthcare clinic (PHC) for treatment maintenance to those who remained at a doctor-managed treatment-initiation site. DESIGN: We conducted a matched cohort analysis among stable HIV patients at the Themba Lethu Clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa. Eligible patients met the criteria for down-referral [undetectable viral load <10 months, antiretroviral therapy (ART) >11 months, CD4 cell count >/=200 cells/mul, stable weight and no opportunistic infections], regardless of whether they were down-referred to a PHC for treatment maintenance between February 2008 and January 2009. Patients were matched 1 : 3 (down-referred : treatment-initiation) using propensity scores. METHODS: We calculated rates and hazard ratios (HRs) for the effect of down-referral on loss to follow-up (LTFU) and mortality and the relative risk of down-referral on viral rebound by 12 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Six hundred and ninety-three down-referred patients were matched to 2079 treatment-initiation patients. Two (0.3%) down-referred and 32 (1.5%) treatment-initiation patients died, 10 (1.4%) down-referred and 87 (4.2%) treatment-initiation patients were lost, and 22 (3.3%) down-referred and 100 (5.6%) treatment-initiation patients experienced viral rebound by 12 months of follow-up. After adjustment, patients down-referred were less likely to die [hazard ratio (HR) 0.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04-0.8], become LTFU (HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.6) or experience viral rebound (relative risk 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9) than treatment-initiation patients during follow-up. CONCLUSION: The utilization of nurse-managed PHCs for treatment maintenance of stable patients could decrease the burden on specialized doctor-managed ART clinics. Patient outcomes for down-referred patients at PHCs appear equal, if not better, than those achieved at ART clinics among stable patients.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on patterns of resistance mutations in pediatric patients in southern Africa, where HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C) predominates. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of pediatric patients. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)- and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-associated resistance mutations quantified from population-based sequencing genotypic resistance assay results taken at time of first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) failure (first-line ART = stavudine [d4T] or zidovudine [ZDV] + lamivudine [3TC] + nevirapine [NVP] or efavirenz [EFV]). RESULTS: Total number of patients with resistance assays analyzed is 45. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated mutation frequencies noted were M184V (n = 41; 91.1%); thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs; n = 20; 44.4%); >1 TAM (n = 9; 20%); TAM-2 pathway (n = 10; 22.2%); TAM-1 pathway (n = 7; 15.6%); TAM-1 and TAM-2 pathways (n = 3; 6.7%); K65R (n = 2; 4.4%); Q151M (n = 1; 2.2%); and L74V (n = 0; 0%). Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated mutation frequencies noted were associated with notable resistance to either/both NVP and EFV (n = 40; 88.9%); K103N (n = 15; 33.3%); >/=1 mutations associated with etravirine (ETR) failure (K101E, Y181C, and G190A; n =20; 44.4%); and >/=2 notable NNRTI mutations (n = 12; 26.7%). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, low-genetic barrier mutations were common, as were TAMs, including more than 1 TAM. Mutations compromising nonthymidine analogue backbones were rare, suggesting that it is likely that children who fail first-line NRTI backbones containing d4T or ZDV/3TC would still respond to abacavir (ABC), didanosine (ddI), and, for adolescents, tenofovir (TDF). Our data support the empiric continuation of 3TC in second-line regimens.</td>

      <td>Antiretroviral drug supply challenges in the era of scaling up ART in Malawi.</td>
      <td>The number of people receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) has increased considerably in recent years and is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. A major challenge is to maintain uninterrupted supplies of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and prevent stock outs. This article discusses issues around the management of ARVs and prevention of stock outs in Malawi, a low-income country with a high HIV/AIDS burden, and a weak procurement and supply chain management system. This system for ARVs, paid for by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and bypassing the government Central Medical Stores, is in place, using the United Nations Children's Fund's (UNICEF's) procurement services. The system, managed by a handful of people who spend limited time on supply management, is characterized by a centrally coordinated quantification based on verified data from all national ART clinics, parallel procurement through UNICEF, and direct distribution to ART clinics. The model worked well in the first years of the ART programme with a single first-line ARV regimen, but with more regimens becoming available (e.g., alternative first-line, second-line and paediatric regimens), it has become more difficult to administer. Managing supplies through a parallel system has the advantage that weaknesses in the national system have limited influence on the ARV procurement and supply chain management system. However, as the current system operates without a central warehouse and national buffer stock capacity, it diminishes the ability to prevent ARV stock outs. The process of ordering ARVs, from the time that estimates are made to the arrival of supplies in health facilities, takes approximately one year. Addressing the challenges involved in maintaining ARVs through an efficient procurement and supply chain management system that prevents ARV stock outs through the establishment of a dedicated procurement team, a central warehouse and/or national buffer stock is a priority.</td>

      <td>Effect of point-of-care CD4 cell count tests on retention of patients and rates of antiretroviral therapy initiation in primary health clinics: an observational cohort study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Loss to follow-up of HIV-positive patients before initiation of antiretroviral therapy can exceed 50% in low-income settings and is a challenge to the scale-up of treatment. We implemented point-of-care counting of CD4 cells in Mozambique and assessed the effect on loss to follow-up before immunological staging and treatment initiation. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, data for enrolment into HIV management and initiation of antiretroviral therapy were extracted retrospectively from patients' records at four primary health clinics providing HIV treatment and point-of-care CD4 services. Loss to follow-up and the duration of each preparatory step before treatment initiation were measured and compared with baseline data from before the introduction of point-of-care CD4 testing. FINDINGS: After the introduction of point-of-care CD4 the proportion of patients lost to follow-up before completion of CD4 staging dropped from 57% (278 of 492) to 21% (92 of 437) (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.2, 95% CI 0.15-0.27). Total loss to follow-up before initiation of antiretroviral treatment fell from 64% (314 of 492) to 33% (142 of 437) (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.21-0.36) and the proportion of enrolled patients initiating antiretroviral therapy increased from 12% (57 of 492) to 22% (94 of 437) (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.42-2.96). The median time from enrolment to antiretroviral therapy initiation reduced from 48 days to 20 days (p<0.0001), primarily because of a reduction in the median time taken to complete CD4 staging, which decreased from 32 days to 3 days (p<0.0001). Loss to follow-up between staging and antiretroviral therapy initiation did not change significantly (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.49-1.45). INTERPRETATION: Point-of-care CD4 testing enabled clinics to stage patients rapidly on-site after enrolment, which reduced opportunities for pretreatment loss to follow-up. As a result, more patients were identified as eligible for and initiated antiretroviral treatment. Point-of-care testing might therefore be an effective intervention to reduce pretreatment loss to follow-up. FUNDING: Absolute Return for Kids and UNITAID.</td>

      <td>Effectiveness of a sports-based HIV prevention intervention in the Dominican Republic: a quasi-experimental study.</td>
      <td>Previous observational and quasi-experimental studies in sub-Saharan Africa have suggested the effectiveness of youth-targeted HIV prevention interventions using sport as an educational tool. No studies have yet assessed the effect of similar programs in the Caribbean. A quasi-experimental trial was conducted to assess the effectiveness of a sports-based intervention in six migrant settlements in the Puerto Plata Province of the Dominican Republic. A total of 397 structured interviews were conducted with 140 adolescents prior to, immediately following, and four months following 10-hour interventions using the Grassroot Soccer curriculum. Interview responses were coded, aggregated into composite scores, and analyzed using logistic regression, adjusting for baseline differences as well as age, sex, community, and descent. At post-intervention, significant differences were observed between groups in HIV-related knowledge (adjOR = 13.02, 95% CI = 8.26, 20.52), reported attitudes (adjOR = 12.01, 95% CI = 7.61, 18.94), and reported communication (adjOR = 3.13, 95% CI = 1.91, 5.12). These differences remained significant at four-month follow-up, though declines in post-intervention knowledge were observed in the Intervention group while gains in knowledge and reported attitudes were observed in the Control group. Results suggest that this sports-based intervention could play a valuable role in HIV prevention efforts in the Caribbean, particularly those targeting early adolescents.

      <td>Factors associated with default from treatment among tuberculosis patients in Nairobi province, Kenya: a case control study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Successful treatment of tuberculosis (TB) involves taking anti-tuberculosis drugs for at least six months. Poor adherence to treatment means patients remain infectious for longer, are more likely to relapse or succumb to tuberculosis and could result in treatment failure as well as foster emergence of drug resistant tuberculosis. Kenya is among countries with high tuberculosis burden globally. The purpose of this study was to determine the duration tuberculosis patients stay in treatment before defaulting and factors associated with default in Nairobi. METHODS: A Case-Control study; Cases were those who defaulted from treatment and Controls those who completed treatment course between January 2006 and March 2008. All (945) defaulters and 1033 randomly selected controls from among 5659 patients who completed treatment course in 30 high volume sites were enrolled. Secondary data was collected using a facility questionnaire. From among the enrolled, 120 cases and 154 controls were randomly selected and interviewed to obtain primary data not routinely collected. Data was analyzed using SPSS and Epi Info statistical software. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine association and Kaplan-Meier method to determine probability of staying in treatment over time were applied. RESULTS: Of 945 defaulters, 22.7% (215) and 20.4% (193) abandoned treatment within first and second months (intensive phase) of treatment respectively. Among 120 defaulters interviewed, 16.7% (20) attributed their default to ignorance, 12.5% (15) to traveling away from treatment site, 11.7% (14) to feeling better and 10.8% (13) to side-effects. On multivariate analysis, inadequate knowledge on tuberculosis (OR 8.67; 95% CI 1.47-51.3), herbal medication use (OR 5.7; 95% CI 1.37-23.7), low income (OR 5.57, CI 1.07-30.0), alcohol abuse (OR 4.97; 95% CI 1.56-15.9), previous default (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.16-4.68), co-infection with Human immune-deficient Virus (HIV) (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.25-1.94) and male gender (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.15-1.78) were independently associated with default. CONCLUSION: The rate of defaulting was highest during initial two months, the intensive phase of treatment. Multiple factors were attributed by defaulting patients as cause for abandoning treatment whereas several were independently associated with default. Enhanced patient pre-treatment counseling and education about TB is recommended.</td>

      <td>Early outcomes and the virological effect of delayed treatment switching to second-line therapy in an antiretroviral roll-out programme in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: More patients in resource-limited settings are starting second-line antiretroviral treatment (ART) following first-line ART failure. We aimed to describe predictors of lack of virological suppression in HIV-infected patients on second-line ART in a roll-out programme in South Africa. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on an adult HIV treatment cohort who started second-line ART (lopinavir/ritonavir, didanosine and zidovudine) after virological failure of first-line ART (two consecutive HIV RNA>1,000 copies/ml). Predictors of week 24 lack of suppression (HIV RNA>400 copies/ml) on second-line ART were determined by bivariate analysis where missing equals failure. A multivariable model that adjusted for gender, age and time to ART switch was used. We tested these findings in sensitivity analyses defining lack of suppression at week 24 as HIV RNA>1,000 and >5,000 copies/ml. RESULTS: Of 6,339 patients on ART, 202 started second-line ART. At week 24, an estimated 41% (95% CI 34-47) did not achieve virological suppression. Female sex (adjusted OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.03-4.88) and time to ART switch (adjusted OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.14 for each additional month) increased the risk of lack of virological suppression. Age, CD4(+) T-cell count and HIV RNA at second-line ART initiation did not predict this outcome. In multivariate models, these findings were insensitive to the definition of lack of virological suppression. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of HIV-infected patients do not achieve virological suppression by week 24 of second-line ART. Women and patients with delayed start of second-line ART after first-line ART failure were at an increased risk of lack of virological suppression.</td>

      <td>Benefit of viral load testing for confirmation of immunological failure in HIV patients treated in rural Malawi.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: Viral load testing is used in the HIV programme of Chiradzulu, Malawi, to confirm the diagnosis of immunological failure to prevent unnecessary switching to second-line therapy. Our objective was to quantify the benefit of this strategy for management of treatment failure in a large decentralized HIV programme in Africa. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of monitoring data from adults treated with first-line antiretroviral regimens for >1 year and meeting the WHO immunological failure criteria in an HIV programme in rural Malawi. The positive predictive value of using immunological failure criteria to diagnose virological failure (viral load >5000 copies/ml) was estimated. RESULTS: Of the 227 patients with immunological failure (185 confirmed with a repeat CD4 measurement), 155 (68.2%) had confirmatory viral load testing. Forty-four (28.4%) had viral load >5000 copies/ml and 57 (36.8%) >1000 copies/ml. Positive predictive value was 28.4% (95% CI 21.4-36.2%). Repeat CD4 count testing showed that 41% of patients initially diagnosed with immunological failure did no longer meet failure criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the need for confirming all cases of immunological failure with viral load testing before switching to second-line ART to optimize the use of resources in developing countries.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVES: To assess whether T-cell activation independently predicts the extent of CD4(+) T-cell recovery and mortality in HIV-infected Ugandans initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: HIV-infected adults starting ART and achieving a plasma HIV RNA level (VL) less than 400 copies/ml by month 6 were sampled from the Uganda AIDS Rural Treatment Outcomes (UARTO) cohort in Mbarara, Uganda. CD4 count, VL, and the percentage-activated (CD38(+)HLA-DR(+)) T cells were measured every 3 months. RESULTS: Of 451 HIV-infected Ugandans starting ART, most were women (70%) with median pre-ART values: age, 34 years; CD4 count, 135 cells/mul; and VL, 5.1 log(10) copies/ml. Of these, 93% achieved a VL less than 400 copies/ml by month 6 and were followed for a median of 24 months, with 8% lost to follow-up at 3 years. Higher pre-ART CD8(+) T-cell activation was associated with diminished CD4 recovery after year 1, after adjustment for pre-ART CD4 count, VL, and sex (P = 0.017). Thirty-four participants died, 15 after month 6. Each 10% point increase in activated CD8(+) T cells at month 6 of suppressive ART was associated with a 1.6-fold increased hazard of subsequent death after adjusting for pretherapy CD4 count (P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Higher pre-ART CD8(+) T-cell activation independently predicts slower CD4(+) T-cell recovery and higher persistent CD8(+) T-cell activation during ART-mediated viral suppression independently predicts increased mortality among HIV-infected Ugandans. Novel therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing or reversing immune activation during ART are needed in this setting.</td>

      <td>Optimizing antiretroviral product selection: a sample approach to improving patient outcomes, saving money, and scaling-up health services in developing countries.</td>
      <td>Over the last decade, increased funding to support HIV treatment programs has enabled millions of new patients in developing countries to access the medications they need. Today, although demand for antiretrovirals continues to grow, the financial crisis has severely constrained funding leaving countries with difficult choices on program prioritization. Product optimization is one solution countries can pursue to continue to improve patient care while also uncovering savings that can be used for further scale up or other health system needs. Program managers can make procurement decisions that actually reduce program costs by considering additional factors beyond World Health Organization guidelines when making procurement decisions. These include in-country product availability, convenience, price, and logistics such as supply chain implications and laboratory testing requirements. Three immediate product selection opportunities in the HIV space include using boosted atazanavir in place of lopinovir for second-line therapy, lamivudine instead of emtricitabine in both first-line and second-line therapy, and tenofovir + lamivudine over abacavir + didanosine in second-line therapy. If these 3 opportunities were broadly implemented in sub-Saharan Africa and India today, approximately $300 million of savings would be realized over the next 5 years, enabling hundreds of thousands of additional patients to be treated. Although the discussion herein is specific to antriretrovirals, the principles of product selection are generalizable to diseases with multiple treatment options and fungible commodity procurement. Identifying and implementing approaches to overcome health system inefficiencies will help sustain and may expand quality care in resource-limited settings.</td>

      <td>Scale-up of antiretroviral treatment in sub-Saharan Africa is accompanied by increasing HIV-1 drug resistance mutations in drug-naive patients.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the frequency and progression over time of the WHO-defined transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance mutations (DRMs) among antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naive HIV-1-infected patients in Cameroon. DESIGN: We analyzed HIV-1 DRM data generated from 369 ART-naive individuals consecutively recruited between 1996 and 2007 in urban and rural areas in Cameroon. METHODS: HIV-1 drug resistance genotyping was performed in the pol gene using plasma samples and surveillance DRMs were identified using the 2009 WHO-DRM list. RESULTS: We observed in Yaounde, the capital city, an increasing prevalence of DRMs over time: 0.0% (none of 61 participants) in 1996-1999; 1.9% (one of 53 participants) in 2001; 4.1% (two of 49 participants) in 2002; and 12.3% (10 of 81 participants) in 2007. In the rural areas with more recently implemented ART programs, we found DRMs in six of 125 (4.8%) ART-naive individuals recruited in 2006-2007. DRMs identified in both areas included resistance mutations to protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-NRTIs (NNRTIs) that might impair the efficacy of available first-line and second-line treatments. CONCLUSION: This report showed an increase in transmitted DRMs in areas where antiretroviral drugs were introduced earlier, although other factors such as natural viral polymorphisms and acquired DRMs through exposure to antiretroviral cannot be totally excluded. Further surveillances are needed to confirm this evolution and inform public health policies on adequate actions to help limit the selection and transmission of drug-resistant HIV, while scaling up access to ART in developing countries.</td>

      <td>Barriers to antiretroviral therapy adherence in rural Mozambique.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: HIV is treated as a chronic disease, but high lost-to-follow-up rates and poor adherence to medication result in higher mortality, morbidity, and viral mutation. Within 18 clinical sites in rural Zambezia Province, Mozambique, patient adherence to antiretroviral therapy has been sub-optimal. METHODS: To better understand barriers to adherence, we conducted 18 community and clinic focus groups in six rural districts. We interviewed 76 women and 88 men, of whom 124 were community participants (CP; 60 women, 64 men) and 40 were health care workers (HCW; 16 women, 24 men) who provide care for those living with HIV. RESULTS: While there was some consensus, both CP and HCW provided complementary insights. CP focus groups noted a lack of confidentiality and poor treatment by hospital staff (42% CP vs. 0% HCW), doubt as to the benefits of antiretroviral therapy (75% CP vs. 0% HCW), and sharing medications with family members (66% CP vs. 0%HCW). Men expressed a greater concern about poor treatment by HCW than women (83% men vs. 0% women). Health care workers blamed patient preference for traditional medicine (42% CP vs. 100% HCW) and the side effects of medication for poor adherence (8% CP vs. 83% CHW). CONCLUSIONS: Perspectives of CP and HCW likely reflect differing sociocultural and educational backgrounds. Health care workers must understand community perspectives on causes of suboptimal adherence as a first step toward effective intervention.</td>

      <td>Antiretroviral drug resistance in patients failing non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based first-line combination antiretroviral treatment (ART) is influenced by: regimen choice, HIV-1 subtype, detection of and response to therapy failure. In order to describe resistance patterns by genotypic testing, at the time of first-line ART failure and to describe associations with having M184I/V, K65R, three or more thymidine analog mutations (TAMs) and etravirine (ETV) resistance, the prevalence of antiretroviral drug resistance associated mutations in a cross-sectional study, at two South African public health clinic settings, at the time of virologic failure (HIV-1 RNA load >400 copies/ml) are described. Also reported are associations of therapy choice, prolonged virologic failure, and concurrent HIV viral load and CD4 count with the presence of M184I/V, TAMs, K65R, and resistance to ETV. Of 167 adult patients with virologic failure on first-line ART, 28 (17%) had no resistance, 137 (82%) had NNRTI resistance, 101 (60%) M184I/V, 20 (12%) TAMs, of which 4 had 3 or more TAMs, and 7 (4%) had K65R, of which 6 were on D4T and one on AZT. A prolonged estimated period of failure was associated with having >/=3 TAMs. Patients treated with nevirapine (NVP) were more likely to have ETV resistance than those treated with efavirenz (EFV). Major protease inhibitor mutations were not detected. A delayed response to ART failure may risk accumulation of TAMs in patients on an NNRTI-based regimen. The use of NVP rather than EFV was associated with ETV resistance.</td>

      <td>Pregnancy and virologic response to antiretroviral therapy in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Although women of reproductive age are the largest group of HIV-infected individuals in sub-Saharan Africa, little is known about the impact of pregnancy on response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in that setting. We examined the effect of incident pregnancy after HAART initiation on virologic response to HAART. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluated a prospective clinical cohort of adult women who initiated HAART in Johannesburg, South Africa between 1 April 2004 and 30 September 2009, and followed up until an event, death, transfer, drop-out, or administrative end of follow-up on 31 March 2010. Women over age 45 and women who were pregnant at HAART initiation were excluded from the study; final sample size for analysis was 5,494 women. Main exposure was incident pregnancy, experienced by 541 women; main outcome was virologic failure, defined as a failure to suppress virus to </= 400 copies/ml by six months or virologic rebound >400 copies/ml thereafter. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios using marginal structural Cox proportional hazards models and weighted lifetable analysis to calculate adjusted five-year risk differences. The weighted hazard ratio for the effect of pregnancy on time to virologic failure was 1.34 (95% confidence limit [CL] 1.02, 1.78). Sensitivity analyses generally confirmed these main results. CONCLUSIONS: Incident pregnancy after HAART initiation was associated with modest increases in both relative and absolute risks of virologic failure, although uncontrolled confounding cannot be ruled out. Nonetheless, these results reinforce that family planning is an essential part of care for HIV-positive women in sub-Saharan Africa. More work is needed to confirm these findings and to explore specific etiologic pathways by which such effects may operate.</td>

The median time between two sequential resistance tests was 5 months (IQR: 3-10). Thymidine analogue mutations accumulated at a rate of 0.07 mutation per month of drug exposure, which is faster than previously reported.

      <td>Retention in care and connection to care among HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy in Africa: estimation via a sampling-based approach.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Current estimates of retention among HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Africa consider patients who are lost to follow-up (LTF) as well as those who die shortly after their last clinic visit to be no longer in care and to represent limitations in access to care. Yet many lost patients may have "silently" transferred and deaths shortly after the last clinic visit more likely represent limitations in clinical care rather than access to care after initial linkage. METHODS: We evaluated HIV-infected adults initiating ART from 1/1/2004 to 9/30/2007 at a clinic in rural Uganda. A representative sample of lost patients was tracked in the community to obtain updated information about care at other ART sites. Updated outcomes were incorporated with probability weights to obtain "corrected" estimates of retention for the entire clinic population. We used the competing risks approach to estimate "connection to care"--the percentage of patients accessing care over time (including those who died while in care). RESULTS: Among 3,628 patients, 829 became lost, 128 were tracked and in 111, updated information was obtained. Of 111, 79 (71%) were alive and 35/48 (73%) of patients interviewed in person were in care and on ART. Patient retention for the clinic population assuming lost patients were not in care was 82.3%, 68.9%, and 60.1% at 1, 2 and 3 years. Incorporating updated care information from the sample of lost patients increased estimates of patient retention to 85.8% to 90.9%, 78.9% to 86.2% and 75.8% to 84.7% at the same time points. CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for "silent transfers" and early deaths increased estimates of patient retention and connection to care substantially. Deaths soon after the last clinic visit (potentially reflecting limitations in clinical effectiveness) and disconnection from care among patient who were alive each accounted for approximately half of failures of retention.</td>

      <td>The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of hepatitis B and hepatitis C coinfections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected adults at an HIV center in Gaborone, Botswana. A retrospective review was performed of charts of currently active HIV-infected adult patients in the Family Model Clinic (FMC) of the Botswana-Baylor Children's Clinical Center of Excellence (BCOE) in Gaborone, Botswana, for the results of serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antihepatitis C IgG tests performed between January 1, 2005 and December 15, 2009. Of 308 active FMC patients, 266 underwent HBsAg serology testing within the period of study. The HBsAg coinfection prevalence was 5.3% (14/266); 2 of 252 patients had at least one positive antihepatitis C IgG serology, a 0.8% prevalence. Hepatitis B coinfection is relatively common in HIV-infected adults at our center in Botswana, whereas hepatitis C coinfection is rare. In this setting, where the diagnosis of hepatitis B coinfection with HIV has implications for choice of first-line antiretroviral therapy and prevention of perinatal hepatitis B transmission, broader sampling to establish the true population prevalence of hepatitis B coinfection and the desirability of adding screening to HIV management should be considered. These findings provide little justification for adding hepatitis C coinfection screening to the management of HIV infection in Botswana.</td>

      <td>Treatment outcomes and cost-effectiveness of shifting management of stable ART patients to nurses in South Africa: an observational cohort.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: To address human resource and infrastructure shortages, resource-constrained countries are being encouraged to shift HIV care to lesser trained care providers and lower level health care facilities. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of down-referring stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) patients from a doctor-managed, hospital-based ART clinic to a nurse-managed primary health care facility in Johannesburg, South Africa. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Criteria for down-referral were stable ART (>/=11 mo), undetectable viral load within the previous 10 mo, CD4>200 cells/mm(3), <5% weight loss over the last three visits, and no opportunistic infections. All patients down-referred from the treatment-initiation site to the down-referral site between 1 February 2008 and 1 January 2009 were compared to a matched sample of patients eligible for down-referral but not down-referred. Outcomes were assigned based on vital and health status 12 mo after down-referral eligibility and the average cost per outcome estimated from patient medical record data. The down-referral site (n = 712) experienced less death and loss to follow up than the treatment-initiation site (n = 2,136) (1.7% versus 6.2%, relative risk = 0.27, 95% CI 0.15-0.49). The average cost per patient-year for those in care and responding at 12 mo was US$492 for down-referred patients and US$551 for patients remaining at the treatment-initiation site (p<0.0001), a savings of 11%. Down-referral was the cost-effective strategy for eligible patients. CONCLUSIONS: Twelve-month outcomes of stable ART patients who are down-referred to a primary health clinic are as good as, or better than, the outcomes of similar patients who are maintained at a hospital-based ART clinic. The cost of treatment with down-referral is lower across all outcomes and would save 11% for patients who remain in care and respond to treatment. These results suggest that this strategy would increase treatment capacity and conserve resources without compromising patient outcomes.</td>

      <td>HIV-1 drug resistance in antiretroviral-naive individuals in sub-Saharan Africa after rollout of antiretroviral therapy: a multicentre observational study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: There are few data on the epidemiology of primary HIV-1 drug resistance after the roll-out of antiretroviral treatment (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to assess the prevalence of primary resistance in six African countries after ART roll-out and if wider use of ART in sub-Saharan Africa is associated with rising prevalence of drug resistance. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional study in antiretroviral-naive adults infected with HIV-1 who had not started first-line ART, recruited between 2007 and 2009 from 11 regions in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. We did population-based sequencing of the pol gene on plasma specimens with greater than 1000 copies per mL of HIV RNA. We identified drug-resistance mutations with the WHO list for transmitted resistance. The prevalence of sequences containing at least one drug-resistance mutation was calculated accounting for the sampling weights of the sites. We assessed the risk factors of resistance with multilevel logistic regression with random coefficients. FINDINGS: 2436 (94.1%) of 2590 participants had a pretreatment genotypic resistance result. 1486 participants (57.4%) were women, 1575 (60.8%) had WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease, and the median CD4 count was 133 cells per muL (IQR 62-204). Overall sample-weighted drug-resistance prevalence was 5.6% (139 of 2436; 95% CI 4.6-6.7), ranging from 1.1% (two of 176; 0.0-2.7) in Pretoria, South Africa, to 12.3% (22 of 179; 7.5-17.1) in Kampala, Uganda. The pooled prevalence for all three Ugandan sites was 11.6% (66 of 570; 8.9-14.2), compared with 3.5% (73 of 1866; 2.5-4.5) for all other sites. Drug class-specific resistance prevalence was 2.5% (54 of 2436; 1.8-3.2) for nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 3.3% (83 of 2436; 2.5-4.2) for non-NRTIs (NNRTIs), 1.3% (31 of 2436; 0.8-1.8) for protease inhibitors, and 1.2% (25 of 2436; 0.7-1.7) for dual-class resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs. The most common drug-resistance mutations were K103N (43 [1.8%] of 2436), thymidine analogue mutations (33 [1.6%] of 2436), M184V (25 [1.2%] of 2436), and Y181C/I (19 [0.7%] of 2436). The odds ratio for drug resistance associated with each additional year since the start of the ART roll-out in a region was 1.38 (95% CI 1.13-1.68; p=0.001). INTERPRETATION: The higher prevalence of primary drug resistance in Uganda than in other African countries is probably related to the earlier start of ART roll-out in Uganda. Resistance surveillance and prevention should be prioritised in settings where ART programmes are scaled up. FUNDING: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands.</td>

      <td>Outcomes of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) among a cohort of South African patients with high HIV prevalence.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major clinical challenge, particularly in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection. MDR-TB treatment is increasingly available, but outcomes have not been well characterized. South Africa has provided MDR-TB treatment for a decade, and we evaluated outcomes by HIV status for patients enrolled between 2000 and 2004 prior to anti-retroviral access. METHODS: We assessed treatment outcomes in a prospective cohort of patients with MDR-TB from eight provincial programs providing second line drugs. World Health Organization definitions were used. Results were stratified by HIV status. RESULTS: Seven hundred fifty seven patients with known HIV status were included in the final analysis, and HIV infection was documented in 287 (38%). Overall, 348 patients (46.0%) were successfully treated, 74 (9.8%) failed therapy, 177 (23.4%) died and 158 (20.9%) defaulted. Patients with HIV were slightly younger and less likely to be male compared to HIV negative patients. Patients with HIV were less likely to have a successful treatment outcome (40.0 vs. 49.6; P<0.05) and more likely to die (35.2 vs. 16.2; P<0.0001). In a competing risk survival analysis, patients with HIV had a higher hazard of death (HR: 2.33, P<0.0001). Low baseline weight (less than 45 kg and less than 60 kg) was also associated with a higher hazard of death (HR: 2.52, P<0.0001; and HR: 1.50, P<0.0001, respectively, compared to weight greater than 60 kg). Weight less than 45 kg had higher risk of failure (HR: 3.58, P<0.01). Any change in treatment regimen was associated with a higher hazard of default (HR: 2.86; 95% CI 1.55-5.29, P<0.001) and a lower hazard of death (HR: 0.63, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this MDR-TB treatment program patients with HIV infection and low weight had higher hazards of death. Overall treatment outcomes were poor. Efforts to improve treatment for MDR-TB are urgently needed.</td>

      <td>Efficient monitoring of HIV-1 vertically infected children in Kenya on first-line antiretroviral therapy.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Worldwide access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in low- and middle-income countries has significantly increased. Although this presents better treatment options for HIV-infected individuals, the challenge of monitoring ART in these settings still remains. OBJECTIVE: To investigate efficient and cost-effective criteria for assessing ART failure among HIV-1-infected children on first-line ART in resource-limited settings. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of 75 HIV-1 vertically infected Kenyan children with a follow-up period of 24 months after initiating ART. Plasma viral load, peripheral CD4(+)T-cell counts and HIV-1 drug-resistance mutations were monitored biannually. RESULTS: Plasma viral load (VL) was suppressed to undetectable level or more than 1.5 log(10) from baseline levels in 53 (70.7%) children within 24 months. VL in the remaining 22 (29.3%) children was not suppressed significantly. Of the 22 children, 21 were infected with HIV-1 strains that developed drug-resistance mutations; 9 within 12 months and 12 between 12 and 24 months. Among the 53 who were successfully treated, VL was suppressed in 33 within 12 months and in 20 between 12 and 24 months. There was no significant difference in VL at baseline and the change of CD4(+)T-cell counts after initiating ART between those treated successfully and the failure groups. CONCLUSION: After initiating ART, children may require longer times to achieve complete viral suppression. Plasma viral load testing 24 months after initiating ART could be used to differentiate ART failures among HIV-1 vertically infected children in resource-limited settings. Additionally, drug resistance testing, if affordable, would be helpful in identifying those failing therapy and in choosing second-line regimens.</td>

      <td>Immunovirological response to combined antiretroviral therapy and drug resistance patterns in children: 1- and 2-year outcomes in rural Uganda.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Children living with HIV continue to be in urgent need of combined antiretroviral therapy (ART). Strategies to scale up and improve pediatric HIV care in resource-poor regions, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, require further research from these settings. We describe treatment outcomes in children treated in rural Uganda after 1 and 2 years of ART start. METHODS: Cross-sectional assessment of all children treated with ART for 12 (M12) and 24 (M24) months was performed. CD4 counts, HIV RNA levels, antiretroviral resistance patterns, and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) plasma concentrations were determined. Patient adherence and antiretroviral-related toxicity were assessed. RESULTS: Cohort probabilities of retention in care were 0.86 at both M12 and M24. At survey, 71 (83%, M12) and 32 (78%, M24) children remained on therapy, and 84% participated in the survey. At ART start, 39 (45%) were female; median age was 5 years. Median initial CD4 percent was 11% [IQR 9-15] in children < 5 years old (n = 12); CD4 count was 151 cells/mm(3) [IQR 38-188] in those >/= 5 years old (n = 26). At M12, median CD4 gains were 11% [IQR 10-14] in patients < 5 years old, and 206 cells/mm(3) [IQR 98-348] in >/= 5 years old. At M24, median CD4 gains were 11% [IQR 5-17] and 132 cells/mm(3) [IQR 87-443], respectively. Viral suppression (< 400 copies/mL) was achieved in 59% (M12) and 33% (M24) of children. Antiretroviral resistance was found in 25% (M12) and 62% (M24) of children. Overall, 29% of patients had subtherapeutic NNRTI plasma concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: After one year of therapy, satisfactory survival and immunological responses were observed, but nearly 1 in 4 children developed viral resistance and/or subtherapeutic plasma antiretroviral drug levels. Regular weight-adjustment dosing and strategies to reinforce and maintain ART adherence are essential to maximize duration of first-line therapy in children in resource-limited countries.</td>

      <td>Loss to follow-up in a community clinic in South Africa--roles of gender, pregnancy and CD4 count.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Faith-based organisations have expanded antiretroviral therapy (ART) in community clinics across South Africa. Loss to follow-up (LTFU), however, limits the potential individual and population treatment benefits and optimal care. OBJECTIVE: To identify patient characteristics associated with LTFU 6 months after starting ART in a large community clinic. METHODS: Patients initiating ART between April 2004 and October 2006 in one South African Catholic Bishops' Conference HIV treatment clinic who had at least one follow-up visit were included and routinely monitored every 6 months after ART initiation. Standardised instruments were used to collect data. Rates of LTFU over time were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazard regression examined the impact of age, baseline CD4 count, baseline HIV RNA, gender and pregnancy status on LTFU. RESULTS: Data from 925 patients (age >14 years, median age 36 years, 70% female, of whom 16% were pregnant) were included: 51 (6%) were lost to follow-up 6 months after ART initiation. Younger age (< or = 30 years) (hazard ratio (HR) 2.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 - 4.38) and pregnancy for women (HR 3.75, 95% CI 1.53 - 9.16) were significantly associated with higher LTFU rates. When stratified by baseline CD4 count, gender and pregnancy status, pregnant women with lower baseline CD4 counts (< or = 200 cells/microl) had 6.06 times the hazard (95% CI 2.20 - 16.71) of LTFU at 6 months compared with men. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected pregnant women initiating ART were significantly more likely to be lost to follow-up in a community clinic in South Africa. Urgent interventions to successfully retain pregnant women in care are needed.</td>

      <td>Adherence to tablet and liquid formulations of antiretroviral medication for paediatric HIV treatment at an urban clinic in Uganda.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Major obstacles remain in scaling up paediatric HIV treatment, including limited paediatric anti-retroviral drug options for resource-limited settings, challenges with adherence to liquid formulations and treatment fatigue with lifelong therapy. AIM: To determine levels of adherence to HAART in HIV-infected children at 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks of follow-up and to compare adherence levels before and after switching from syrup to fixed-dose combination (FDC)-tablet anti-retroviral formulations. METHODS: HIV-infected children aged between 6 months and 12 years were initiated on anti-retroviral therapy at Makerere University-Johns Hopkins University Care Clinic, Kampala. Good adherence to HAART was defined as taking >/=95% of prescribed medications. Adherence levels were measured using pharmacy refill data, quarterly unannounced home-visit pill counts and caregiver self-reports. Data were analysed using STATA((R)) version 10.0. RESULTS: A total of 129 HIV-infected children were initiated on HAART with 14.7% on syrups and 85.3% on tablet formulations at enrollment. According to caregiver self-reporting, 99.2%, 100%, 100% and 99.2% achieved >/=95% adherence at 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks, respectively. Using pharmacy refill data, the proportions were 89.9%, 95.4%, 93.8% and 93.0% and for unannounced home visits were 89.8%, 92.4%, 88.9% and 86.2%, respectively. Median adherence to syrup formulations (97%, IQR 93-98) was significantly lower than for tablets (100%, IQR 97-100, p = 0.012, n = 28) using pharmacy refill data. Viral suppression correlated with home visit and pharmacy refill adherence data. CONCLUSION: The majority of children initiating HAART had good adherence when estimated by caregiver self-report and pharmacy refill data but lower adherence when measured by home-visit pill counts. Adherence to tablet formulation of HAART was significantly better than syrup formulation. Medication formulation did not significantly affect viral suppression.</td>

      <td>Life expectancy of persons receiving combination antiretroviral therapy in low-income countries: a cohort analysis from Uganda.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Little is known about the effect of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) on life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE: To estimate life expectancy of patients once they initiate cART in Uganda. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Public sector HIV and AIDS disease-management program in Uganda. PATIENTS: 22 315 eligible patients initiated cART during the study period, of whom 1943 were considered to have died. MEASUREMENTS: All-cause mortality rates were calculated and abridged life tables were constructed and stratified by sex and baseline CD4 cell count status to estimate life expectancies for patients receiving cART. The average number of years remaining to be lived by patients who received cART at varying age categories was estimated. RESULTS: After adjustment for loss to follow-up, crude mortality rates (deaths per 1000 person-years) ranged from 26.9 (95% CI, 25.4 to 28.5) in women to 43.9 (CI, 40.7 to 47.0) in men. For patients with a baseline CD4 cell count less than 0.050 x 10(9) cells/L, the mortality rate was 67.3 (CI, 62.1 to 72.9) deaths per 1000 person-years, whereas among persons with a baseline CD4 cell count of 0.250 x 10(9) cells/L or more, the mortality rate was 19.1 (CI, 16.0 to 22.7) deaths per 1000 person-years. Life expectancy at age 20 years for the overall cohort was 26.7 (CI, 25.0 to 28.4) additional years and at age 35 years was 27.9 (CI, 26.7 to 29.1) additional years. Life expectancy increased substantially with increasing baseline CD4 cell count. Similar trends are observed for older age groups. LIMITATIONS: A small (6.4%) proportion of patients were lost to follow-up, and it was imputed that 30% of these patients had died. Few patients with a CD4 cell count greater than 0.250 x 10(9) cells/L initiated cART. CONCLUSION: Ugandan patients receiving cART can expect an almost normal life expectancy, although there is considerable variability among subgroups of patients.

      <td>Accuracy of the Xpert MTB/RIF test for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in children admitted to hospital in Cape Town, South Africa: a descriptive study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: WHO recommends that Xpert MTB/RIF replaces smear microscopy for initial diagnosis of suspected HIV-associated tuberculosis or multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis, but no data exist for its use in children. We aimed to assess the accuracy of the test for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in children in an area with high tuberculosis and HIV prevalences. METHODS: In this prospective, descriptive study, we enrolled children aged 15 years or younger who had been admitted to one of two hospitals in Cape Town, South Africa, with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis between Feb 19, 2009, and Nov 30, 2010. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of MTB/RIF and concentrated, fluorescent acid-fast smear with a reference standard of liquid culture from two sequential induced sputum specimens (primary analysis). RESULTS: 452 children (median age 19.4 months, IQR 11.1-46.2) had at least one induced sputum specimen; 108 children (24%) had HIV infection. 27 children (6%) had a positive smear result, 70 (16%) had a positive culture result, and 58 (13%) had a positive MTB/RIF test result. With mycobacterial culture as the reference standard, MTB/RIF tests when done on two induced sputum samples detected twice as many cases (75.9%, 95% CI 64.5-87.2) as did smear microscopy (37.9%, 25.1-50.8), detecting all of 22 smear-positive cases and 22 of 36 (61.1%, 44.4-77.8) smear-negative cases. For smear-negative cases, the incremental increase in sensitivity from testing a second specimen was 27.8% for MTB/RIF, compared with 13.8% for culture. The specificity of MTB/RIF was 98.8% (97.6-99.9). MTB/RIF results were available in median 1 day (IQR 0-4) compared with median 12 days (9-17) for culture (p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: MTB/RIF testing of two induced sputum specimens is warranted as the first-line diagnostic test for children with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis.

      <td>Patients who miss clinic appointments make unscheduled visits which compromise the ability to plan for and deliver quality care. We implemented Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and same day patient tracing to minimize missed appointments in a community-based HIV clinic in Kampala. Missed, early, on-schedule appointments and waiting times were evaluated before (pre-EMR) and 6 months after implementation of EMR and patient tracing (post-EMR). Reasons for missed appointments were documented pre and post-EMR. The mean daily number of missed appointments significantly reduced from 21 pre-EMR to 8 post-EMR. The main reason for missed appointments was forgetting (37%) but reduced significantly by 30% post-EMR. Loss to follow-up (LTFU) also significantly decreased from 10.9 to 4.8% The total median waiting time to see providers significantly decreased from 291 to 94 min. Our findings suggest that EMR and same day patient tracing can significantly reduce missed appointments, and LTFU and improve clinic efficiency.</td>

      <td>Retention and attrition during the preparation phase and after start of antiretroviral treatment in Thyolo, Malawi, and Kibera, Kenya: implications for programmes?</td>
      <td>Among adults eligible for antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Thyolo (rural Malawi) and Kibera (Nairobi, Kenya), this study (a) reports on retention and attrition during the preparation phase and after starting ART and (b) identifies risk factors associated with attrition. 'Retention' implies being alive and on follow-up, whilst 'attrition' implies loss to follow-up, death or stopping treatment (if on ART). There were 11,309 ART-eligible patients from Malawi and 3633 from Kenya, of whom 8421 (74%) and 2792 (77%), respectively, went through the preparation phase and started ART. In Malawi, 2649 patients (23%) were lost to attrition in the preparation phase and 2189 (26%) after starting ART. Similarly, in Kenya 546 patients (15%) were lost to attrition in the ART preparation phase and 647 (23%) while on ART. Overall programme attrition was 43% (4838/11,309) for Malawi and 33% (1193/3633) for Kenya. Restricting cohort evaluation to 'on ART' (as is usually done) underestimates overall programme attrition by 38% in Malawi and 36% in Kenya. Risk factors associated with attrition in the preparation phase included male sex, age <35 years, advanced HIV/AIDS disease and increasing malnutrition. Considerable attrition occurs during the preparation phase of ART, and programme evaluations confined to on-treatment analysis significantly underestimate attrition. This has important operational implications, which are discussed here.</td>

      <td>Early mortality and AIDS progression despite high initial antiretroviral therapy adherence and virologic suppression in Botswana.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Adverse outcomes occurring early after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation are common in sub-Saharan Africa, despite reports of high levels of ART adherence in this setting. We sought to determine the relationship between very early ART adherence and early adverse outcomes in HIV-infected adults in Botswana. METHODS: This prospective cohort study of 402 ART-naive, HIV-infected adults initiating ART at a public HIV clinic in Gaborone, Botswana evaluated the relationship between suboptimal early ART adherence and HIV treatment outcomes in the initial months after ART initiation. Early adherence during the interval between initial ART dispensation and first ART refill was calculated using pill counts. In the primary analysis patients not returning to refill and those with adherence <0.95 were considered to have suboptimal early adherence. The primary outcome was death or loss to follow-up during the first 6 months of ART; a secondary composite outcome included the primary outcome plus incident opportunistic illness (OIs) and virologic failure. We also calculated the percent of early adverse outcomes theoretically attributable to suboptimal early adherence using the population attributable risk percent (PAR%). RESULTS: Suboptimal early adherence was independently associated with loss to follow-up and death (adjusted OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.8) and with the secondary composite outcome including incident OIs and virologic failure (adjusted OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.4-4.7). However, of those with early adverse outcomes, less than one-third had suboptimal adherence and approximately two-thirds achieved virologic suppression. The PAR% relating suboptimal early adherence and primary and secondary outcomes were 14.7% and 17.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Suboptimal early adherence was associated with poor outcomes, but most early adverse outcomes occurred in patients with optimal early adherence. Clinical care and research efforts should focus on understanding early adverse outcomes that occur despite optimal adherence.</td>

      <td>Surveillance of transmitted antiretroviral drug resistance among HIV-1 infected women attending antenatal clinics in Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe.</td>
      <td>The rapid scale-up of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and use of single dose Nevirapine (SD NVP) for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (pMTCT) have raised fears about the emergence of resistance to the first line antiretroviral drug regimens. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of primary drug resistance (PDR) in a cohort of young (<25 yrs) HAART-naive HIV pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe. Whole blood was collected in EDTA for CD4 counts, viral load, serological estimation of duration of infection using the BED Calypte assay and genotyping for drug resistance. Four hundred and seventy-one women, mean age 21 years; SD: 2.1 were enrolled into the study between 2006 and 2007. Their median CD4 count was 371cells/microL; IQR: 255-511 cells/microL. Two hundred and thirty-six samples were genotyped for drug resistance. Based on the BED assay, 27% were recently infected (RI) whilst 73% had long-term infection (LTI). Median CD4 count was higher (p<0.05) in RI than in women with LTI. Only 2 women had drug resistance mutations; protease I85V and reverse transcriptase Y181C. Prevalence of PDR in Chitungwiza, 4 years after commencement of the national ART program remained below WHO threshold limit (5%). Frequency of recent infection BED testing is consistent with high HIV acquisition during pregnancy. With the scale-up of long-term ART programs, maintenance of proper prescribing practices, continuous monitoring of patients and reinforcement of adherence may prevent the acquisition and transmission of PDR.</td>

      <td>Unnecessary antiretroviral treatment switches and accumulation of HIV resistance mutations; two arguments for viral load monitoring in Africa.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the consequences of using clinicoimmunological criteria to detect antiretroviral treatment (ART) failure and guide regimen switches in HIV-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa. Frequencies of unnecessary switches, patterns of HIV drug resistance, and risk factors for the accumulation of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-associated mutations were evaluated. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of adults switching ART regimens at 13 clinical sites in 6 African countries was performed. Two types of failure identification were compared: diagnosis of clinicoimmunological failure without viral load testing (CIF only) or CIF with local targeted viral load testing (targeted VL). After study enrollment, reference HIV RNA and genotype were determined retrospectively. Logistic regression assessed factors associated with multiple thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs) and NRTI cross-resistance (>/=2 TAMs or Q151M or K65R/K70E). RESULTS: Of 250 patients with CIF switching to second-line ART, targeted VL was performed in 186. Unnecessary switch at reference HIV RNA <1000 copies per milliliter occurred in 46.9% of CIF only patients versus 12.4% of patients with targeted VL (P < 0.001). NRTI cross-resistance was observed in 48.0% of 183 specimens available for genotypic analysis, comprising >/=2 TAMs (37.7%), K65R (7.1%), K70E (3.3%), or Q151M (3.3%). The presence of NRTI cross-resistance was associated with the duration of ART exposure and zidovudine use. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicoimmunological monitoring without viral load testing resulted in frequent unnecessary regimen switches. Prolonged treatment failure was indicated by extensive NRTI cross-resistance. Access to virological monitoring should be expanded to prevent inappropriate switches, enable early failure detection and preserve second-line treatment options in Africa.</td>

      <td>Lactic acidosis and symptomatic hyperlactataemia in a randomized trial of first-line therapy in HIV-infected adults in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Lactic acidosis (LA) is a potentially life-threatening complication of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. Few randomized prospective studies have compared LA between different ARV regimens. METHODS: Characterization of cases of LA (serum lactate >5 mmol/l and arterial pH<7.35 or bicarbonate <20 mmol/l) and symptomatic hyperlactataemia (SH; serum lactate >2.2 mmol/l and symptoms) was made in a randomized open-label 2x2 factorial study of stavudine/lamivudine (d4T/3TC)-based versus didanosine/zidovudine-based therapy and lopinavir/ritonavir-based versus efavirenz (EFV)-based therapy in 1,771 HIV-infected adults initiating therapy between 2004 and 2008. RESULTS: The LA incident rate was 3.5/1,000 person-years (95% CI 1.8-5.9), and for combined LA/SH was 11.0/1,000 person-years (95% CI 7.9-14.9). There were two deaths (15% mortality) among 13 LA cases; all 11 survivors experienced symptom resolution and started new ARV regimens. LA cases were more likely to be female (OR 7.19, 95% CI 1.84-40.75; P=0.001) and had a higher body mass index (BMI; P<0.0001) compared with non-cases. There was no increase in LA according to ARV regimen, age or CD4(+) T-cell count at randomization. When combined, LA/SH cases (n=41) were more often female (OR 4.76, 95% CI 2.36-10.08; P<0.0001), had increased BMI (P<0.0001), were more likely to be assigned d4T/3TC (OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.50-7.28; P=0.001) and were more likely to be assigned EFV (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.08-4.61; P=0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Female sex and increased BMI were associated with severe LA in this large randomized trial of first-line ARV in South Africa. While female sex, increased BMI and d4T are previously described risk factors for the development of clinically significant lactate elevations, the independent risk associated with EFV is a novel observation warranting further investigation.</td>

      <td>Treatment strategies for Kaposi sarcoma in sub-Saharan Africa: challenges and opportunities.</td>
      <td>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize recent published literature on treatment of AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma, the most common HIV-associated malignancy and a leading cancer diagnosis in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and to highlight the challenges faced in treating Kaposi sarcoma in this resource-limited environment. RECENT FINDINGS: There are few prospective clinical trials for Kaposi sarcoma treatment in SSA, along with a relatively poor cancer treatment infrastructure, leading to late diagnosis and poor access to therapy. The only prospectively randomized trial of chemotherapy compared antiretroviral therapy (HAART) alone to HAART with combination chemotherapy with doxorubicin, bleomycin and vincristine (ABV), and documented a significantly higher rate of tumor regression for the combination along with improvement in quality of life and no adverse effects on HIV control. Other studies suggest that gemcitabine may be an active second-line chemotherapeutic agent after failure of HAART and ABV and suggest that AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma in children may respond well to HAART with chemotherapy. There are also (primarily retrospective) data suggesting a beneficial effect of HAART on Kaposi sarcoma, but some evidence for Kaposi sarcoma as a manifestation of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. SUMMARY: Opportunities and need exist for prospective research to establish evidence-based guidelines for the most effective treatments for Kaposi sarcoma in SSA.</td>

      <td>Implementation of free cotrimoxazole prophylaxis improves clinic retention among antiretroviral therapy-ineligible clients in Kenya.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether implementation of free cotrimoxazole (CTX) provision was associated with improved retention among clients ineligible for antiretroviral therapy (ART) enrolled in an HIV treatment program in Kenya. DESIGN: Data were obtained from a clinical cohort for program evaluation purposes. Twelve-month clinic retention was compared among ART-ineligible clients enrolled in the time period before free CTX versus the time period after. METHODS: Statistical comparisons were made using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log-rank tests, and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. To exclude potential temporal program changes that may have influenced retention, ART clients before and after the same cut-off date were compared. FINDINGS: Among adult clients enrolled between 2005 and 2007, 3234 began ART within 1 year of enrollment, and 1024 of those who did not start treatment were defined as ART-ineligible. ART-ineligible clients enrolled in the period following free CTX provision had higher 12-month retention (84%) than those who enrolled prior to free CTX (63%; P < 0.001). Retention did not change significantly during these periods among ART clients (P = 0.55). In multivariate analysis, ART-ineligible clients enrolled prior to free CTX were more than twice as likely to be lost to follow-up compared to those following free CTX [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 2.64, 95% confidence interval 1.95-3.57, P < 0.001]. CONCLUSION: Provision of free CTX was associated with significantly improved retention among ART-ineligible clients. Retention and CD4-monitoring of ART-ineligible clients are essential to promptly identify ART eligibility and provide treatment. Implementation of free CTX may improve retention in sub-Saharan Africa and, via increasing timely ART initiation, provide survival benefit.</td>

      <td>Development and validation of systems for rational use of viral load testing in adults receiving first-line ART in sub-Saharan Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: World Health Organization (WHO) immunological and clinical criteria for monitoring first-line antiretroviral treatment (ART) offer low accuracy for predicting viral failure. Targeting viral load assays to those at high risk has been recommended and a system to do this has been developed in Cambodia. Systems for use in sub-Saharan African populations were evaluated. METHODS: A new Ugandan-based scoring system for targeting viral load assays was developed from data from the first 4 years of a Ugandan cohort (N = 559) receiving first-line ART. The accuracy of this, the Cambodian system and the WHO criteria to predict viral failure, through targeting viral load assays, were compared in a separate population of 496 Ugandans. RESULTS: The new Ugandan scoring system included CD4 cell count, mean cell volume, adherence, and HIV-associated clinical events as predictors of viral failure. In the validation population, the Ugandan system undertook viral load assays in 61 (12.3%) cases offering 20.5% sensitivity and 100% positive predictive value (PPV) to predict viral failure. The Cambodian system undertook viral load assays in 33 (6.7%) cases producing 23.1% sensitivity and 90.0% PPV. WHO criteria recommended viral load assays in 72 (14.5%) cases offering 30.8% sensitivity and 100% PPV. CONCLUSION: Locally developed algorithms based on clinical and immunological criteria may offer little additional accuracy over WHO criteria for targeting viral load assays. When possible, confirming viral load before switching therapy is recommended. Scoring systems are more flexible than WHO criteria in allowing ART providers to choose the proportion of the population that undergo targeted viral load testing.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVES: Monitoring antiretroviral treatment (ART) outcomes is essential for assessing the success of HIV care and treatment programs in resource-limited settings (RLS). METHODS: Longitudinal analyses of clinical and immunologic parameters in HIV-infected adults initiated on ART between November 2004 and June 2008 at Management and Development for Health (MDH)-Presidents Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief PEPFAR supported HIV care and treatment clinics in Tanzania. RESULTS: A total of 12 842 patients were analyzed (65.9% female, median baseline CD4 count, 106 cells/mm(3)). Significant improvements in immunologic status were observed with an increase in CD4 count to 298 (interquartile range [IQR] 199-416), 372 (256-490) and 427 (314-580) cells/mm(3), at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Overall mortality was 13.1% (1682 of 12 842). Male sex, World Health Organization (WHO) stage III/IV, CD4 <200 cells/mm(3), hemoglobin (Hgb) <8.5 g/dL, and stavudine (d4T)-containing regimens were independently associated with early and overall mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Closer monitoring of males and patients with advanced HIV disease following ART initiation may improve clinical and immunologic outcomes in these individuals.</td>

      <td>Relationship between renal dysfunction, nephrotoxicity and death among HIV adults on tenofovir.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: In April 2010, the South African government added tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to its first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV patients. We analyzed the relationship between renal dysfunction at tenofovir initiation, nephrotoxicity and mortality. DESIGN: Cohort analysis of HIV-infected adults who received tenofovir and had a creatinine clearance done at initiation at the Themba Lethu Clinic, Johannesburg, South Africa, between April 2004 and September 2009. METHODS: We estimated the relationship between renal dysfunction, nephrotoxicity [any decline in kidney function from baseline (acute or chronic) that is secondary to a toxin (including drugs)] and mortality for patients initiated onto tenofovir-containing regimens using marginal structural models and inverse probability of treatment weights to correct estimates for lost to follow-up and confounding. RESULTS: Of 890 patients initiated onto tenofovir, 573 (64.4%) had normal renal function (>/=90 ml/min), 271 (30.4%) had mild renal dysfunction (60-89 ml/min) and 46 (5.2%) had moderate renal dysfunction (30-59 ml/min). A total of 2.4% experienced nephrotoxicity, 7.8% died and 9.7% were lost during 48 months of follow-up. Patients with mild [hazard ratio 4.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-15.2] or moderate (hazard ratio 15.0; 95% CI 3.4-66.5) renal dysfunction were at greatest risk of nephrotoxicity, whereas those with mild (hazard ratio 1.2; 95% CI 0.7-2.3) or moderate (hazard ratio 3.2; 95% CI 1.3-7.8) renal dysfunction vs. normal renal function were at highest risk of death by 48 months. CONCLUSION: Much of the incident renal dysfunction in tenofovir patients is likely related to preexisting renal disorder, which may be exacerbated by tenofovir. With expanded use of tenofovir, screening for renal dysfunction prior to initiation and dose adjustment is necessary to help improve ART outcomes.</td>

      <td>HIV-1 drug resistance at antiretroviral treatment initiation in children previously exposed to single-dose nevirapine.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations at the time of treatment initiation in a large cohort of HIV-infected children previously exposed to single-dose nevirapine (sdNVP) for prevention of transmission. DESIGN: Drug resistance mutations were measured pretreatment in 255 infants and young children under 2 years of age in South Africa exposed to sdNVP and initiating ritonavir-boosted lopinavir-based therapy. Those who achieved viral suppression were randomized to either continue the primary regimen or to switch to a nevirapine-based regimen. Pretreatment samples were tested using population sequencing and real time allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) to detect Y181C and K103N minority variants. Those with confirmed viremia more than 1000 copies/ml by 52 weeks postrandomization in the switch group were defined as having viral failure. RESULTS: Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations, predominantly Y181C, were detected by either method in 62% of infants less than 6 months of age, in 39% of children 6-12 months of age, 22% 12-18 months, and 16% 18-24 months (P = <0.0001). NNRTI mutations detected by genotyping, but not K103N or Y181C mutations detected only by AS-PCR, were associated with viral failure in the switch group. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of mutations known to compromise primary NNRTI-based therapy is high in sdNVP-exposed children, supporting current guidelines recommending use of protease inhibitor-based regimens for young children. Standard genotyping is adequate to identify children who could benefit from switching to NNRTI-based therapy.</td>

      <td>Incidence and risk factors of serious adverse events during antituberculous treatment in Rwanda: a prospective cohort study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) and TB-human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) coinfection is a major public health concern in resource-limited settings. Although TB treatment is challenging in HIV-infected patients because of treatment interactions, immunopathological reactions, and concurrent infections, few prospective studies have addressed this in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study we aimed to determine incidence, causes of, and risk factors for serious adverse events among patients on first-line antituberculous treatment, as well as its impact on antituberculous treatment outcome. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Prospective observational cohort study of adults treated for TB at the Internal Medicine department of the Kigali University Hospital from May 2008 through August 2009. Of 263 patients enrolled, 253 were retained for analysis: median age 35 (Interquartile range, IQR 28-40), 55% male, 66% HIV-positive with a median CD4 count 104 cells/mm(3) (IQR 44-248 cells/mm(3)). Forty percent had pulmonary TB, 43% extrapulmonary TB and 17% a mixed form. Sixty-four (26%) developed a serious adverse event; 58/167 (35%) HIV-infected vs. 6/86 (7%) HIV-uninfected individuals. Commonest events were concurrent infection (n = 32), drug-induced hepatitis (n = 24) and paradoxical reactions/TB-IRIS (n = 23). HIV-infection (adjusted Hazard Ratio, aHR 3.4, 95% Confidence Interval, CI 1.4-8.7) and extrapulmonary TB (aHR 2, 95%CI 1.1-3.7) were associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events. For TB/HIV co-infected patients, extrapulmonary TB (aHR 2.0, 95%CI 1.1-3.9) and CD4 count <100 cells/mm3 at TB diagnosis (aHR 1.7, 95%CI 1.0-2.9) were independent predictors. Adverse events were associated with an almost two-fold higher risk of unsuccessful treatment outcome at 6 months (HR 1.89, 95%CI 1.3-3.0). CONCLUSION: Adverse events frequently complicate the course of antituberculous treatment and worsen treatment outcome, particularly in patients with extrapulmonary TB and advanced immunodeficiency. Concurrent infection accounts for most events. Our data suggest that deterioration in a patient already receiving antituberculous treatment should prompt an aggressive search for additional infections.</td>

      <td>Effect of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy on dysglycemia and insulin sensitivity in South African HIV-infected patients.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Data on the prevalence of the complications of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (diabetes, central fat accumulation, peripheral fat wasting, and dyslipidemia) in sub-Saharan Africa are sparse. We examined the prevalence and associated risk factors of dysglycemia and insulin sensitivity in HIV-infected South Africans. METHODS: HIV-infected patients, on nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART or ART-naive, had oral glucose tolerance tests and clinical anthropometry. Insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function were assessed. RESULTS: The prevalence of dysglycemia in 406 ART-naive patients and 443 patients on ART was 25.7% and 21.9% (P = 0.193), respectively. Dysglycemic patients on ART had a similar body mass index (P = 0.440), greater waist circumference (P = 0.047), and smaller calf skinfold thickness (P = 0.015) than dysglycemic ART-naive patients but no difference in beta-cell function or insulin sensitivity. Normoglycemic patients on ART had a greater body mass index (P = 0.0009), waist circumference (P = 0.0001), and abdominal skinfold thickness (P = 0.040), similar calf skinfold thickness (P = 0.079), and reduced beta-cell function [lower insulinogenic index (P = 0.027) and oral disposition index (D(o), P = 0.020)] compared with normoglycemic ART-naive patients. In multivariate analysis, older age [odds ratio (OR): 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02 to 1.06], male gender (OR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.28 to 2.99), higher CD4 count (OR: 1.0, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.02) and use of efavirenz (OR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.19 to 2.45) were associated with dysglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of dysglycemia in ART-naive and ART patients was similar. Peripheral fat wasting was more common in dysglycemic patients on ART. The association of efavirenz with dysglycemia is important because first-line ART regimens in the developing world include nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and increasingly, efavirenz is selected because of its perceived lower toxicity than nevirapine.</td>

      <td>The net cost of incorporating resistance testing into HIV/AIDS treatment in South Africa: a Markov model with primary data.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Current guidelines for providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa's public sector programme call for switching patients from first-line to second-line treatment upon virologic failure as indicated by two consecutive viral loads above 5000 copies/ml, but without laboratory evidence of viral resistance. We modelled the net cost of adding resistance testing for patients with virological failure and retaining patients without resistance on first-line therapy, rather than switching all failures to second-line therapy. METHODS: Costs were estimated for three scenarios: routine maintenance (standard care without resistance testing, switch all failures to second line); resistance testing (resistance test for patients with failure, switch those with resistance); and limited testing (resistance test for patients with failure in the first three years, switch those with resistance). A Markov model was used to estimate the cost of each arm over five years after first line initiation. Rates of treatment failure, viral resistance and treatment costs were estimated with primary data from a large HIV treatment cohort at a public facility in Johannesburg. Future costs were discounted at 3%. RESULTS: Virological failure rates over five years were 19.8% in routine maintenance and 20.2% in resistance testing and limited testing; 16.8% and 11.4% of failures in routine and limited testing, respectively, did not have any resistance mutations, resulting in 3.1% and 2.0% fewer patients switching to second-line ART by the end of five years. Treatment costs were estimated at US$526 and $1268 per patient per year on first-line and second-line therapy, respectively; a resistance test cost $242. The total average cost per patient over five years was $2780 in routine maintenance; $2775 in resistance testing; and $2763 in limited testing. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating resistance testing into treatment guidelines in South Africa is potentially cost-neutral and can identify other reasons for failure, conserve treatment options, and generate information about emerging resistance patterns.</td>

      <td>Hepatotoxicity from first line antiretroviral therapy: an experience from a resource limited setting.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been associated with liver toxicity. The role of monitoring for liver toxicity has not been well studied in resource-limited settings (RLS). OBJECTIVES: To determine the background prevalence and incidence of liver injury and describe the associated signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis after initiating HAART; and to determine the role of liver enzyme tests in monitoring hepatotoxicity. METHODS: In this prospective study, in Mulago Hospital AIDS Clinics, we consecutively enrolled adult patients initiated on one of three first line HAART regimens [Stavudine (d4T)-Lamivudine (3TC) and nevirapine (NVP); Zidovudine (AZT)-3TC and Efavirenz (EFV) or d4T-3TC-EFV]. We monitored ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and clinical evidence of acute hepatitis at baseline, 2(nd), 6(th), 10(th) and 14(th) week of therapy. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty HIV-positive HAART- naive patients were enrolled in the study. The baseline prevalence of transaminitis was 1.7% with an incidence of 4.2% at 14 weeks. Grade 3-4 hepatotoxicity was documented in 1.3%. Jaundice was seen in grade 2-4 ALT elevations. Being on concurrent HAART and antituberculous drugs was associated with grade 2-4 toxicity compared to those who were only on HAART [OR; 16.0 (95% CI; 2.4-104.2)]. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of severe hepatotoxicity within three months of first-line antiretroviral therapy was low, suggesting that routine measurement of transaminases may not be necessary in all patients initiating HAART in RLS. Routine measurement may be important in following patients on HAART and concurrent TB treatment as well as those with jaundice to avoid missing hepatotoxicity.</td>

      <td>Renal dysfunction among HIV-infected patients starting antiretroviral therapy.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: HIV-related renal dysfunction is associated with high mortality. Data on the prevalence of renal dysfunction among HIV-infected outpatients starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa are limited. Recent recommendations to include the nephrotoxic drug tenofovir in first-line ART regimens make clarification of this issue urgent. METHODS: We screened for renal dysfunction by measuring serum creatinine, proteinuria, and microalbuminuria in HIV-positive outpatients initiating ART in Mwanza, Tanzania. We excluded patients with pre-existing renal disease, hypertension, diabetes, or hepatitis C virus co-infection. Estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) were calculated by Cockroft-Gault and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equations. RESULTS: Only 129 (36%) of 355 enrolled patients had normal eGFRs (grade 0 or 1) above 90 ml/min per 1.73 m. Grade 2 renal dysfunction (eGFR between 60 and 89 ml/min per 1.73 m) was present in 137 patients (38.6%), and 87 patients (25%) had grade 3 dysfunction (eGFR between 30 and 59 ml/min per 1.73 m). Microalbuminuria and proteinuria were detected in 72 and 36% of patients, respectively. Factors predictive of renal dysfunction in multivariate analysis included female sex [odds ratio (OR) 3.0, 95% confidence interval (1.8-5.1), P < 0.0001], BMI less than 18.5 [OR 2.3 (1.3-4.1), P = 0.004], CD4 T-cell count below 200 cells/mul [OR 2.3 (1.1-4.8), P = 0.04], and WHO clinical stage II or above [OR 1.6 (1.2-2.3), P = 0.001]. CONCLUSION: Renal dysfunction was highly prevalent in this population of HIV-positive outpatients initiating first ART in Tanzania. This highlights the critical and underappreciated need to monitor renal function in HIV-positive patients in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly given the increasing use of tenofovir in first-line ART.</td>

      <td>Survival of HIV-infected adolescents on antiretroviral therapy in Uganda: findings from a nationally representative cohort in Uganda.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Adolescents have been identified as a high-risk group for poor adherence to and defaulting from combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) care. However, data on outcomes for adolescents on cART in resource-limited settings remain scarce. METHODS: We developed an observational study of patients who started cART at The AIDS Service Organization (TASO) in Uganda between 2004 and 2009. Age was stratified into three groups: children (</=10 years), adolescents (11-19 years), and adults (>/=20 years). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated to describe time to mortality and loss to follow-up, and Cox regression used to model associations between age and mortality and loss to follow-up. To address loss to follow up, we applied a weighted analysis that assumes 50% of lost patients had died. FINDINGS: A total of 23,367 patients were included in this analysis, including 810 (3.5%) children, 575 (2.5%) adolescents, and 21 982 (94.0%) adults. A lower percentage of children (5.4%) died during their cART treatment compared to adolescents (8.5%) and adults (10%). After adjusting for confounding, other features predicted mortality than age alone. Mortality was higher among males (p<0.001), patients with a low initial CD4 cell count (p<0.001), patients with advanced WHO clinical disease stage (p<0.001), and shorter duration of time receiving cART (p<0.001). The crude mortality rate was lower for children (22.8 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI: 16.1, 29.5), than adolescents (36.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI: 26.3, 46.8) and adults (37.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI: 35.9, 39.1). INTERPRETATION: This study is the largest assessment of adolescents receiving cART in Africa. Adolescents did not have cART mortality outcomes different from adults or children.</td>

      <td>Factors influencing retention in care after starting antiretroviral therapy in a rural South African programme.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: The prognosis of patients with HIV in Africa has improved with the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) but these successes are threatened by low rates of long-term retention in care. There are limited data on predictors of retention in care, particularly from rural sites. METHODS: Prospective cohort analysis of outcome measures in adults from a rural HIV care programme in Madwaleni, Eastern Cape, South Africa. The ART programme operates from Madwaleni hospital and seven primary care feeder clinics with full integration between inpatient and outpatient services. Outreach workers conducted home visits for defaulters. RESULTS: 1803 adults initiated ART from June 2005 to May 2009. At the end of the study period 82.4% were in active care or had transferred elsewhere, 11.1% had died and 6.5% were lost to follow-up (LTFU). Independent predictors associated with an increased risk of LTFU were CD4 nadir >200, initiating ART as an inpatient or while pregnant, and younger age, while being in care for >6 months before initiating ART was associated with a reduced risk. Independent factors associated with an increased risk of mortality were baseline CD4 count <50 and initiating ART as an inpatient, while being in care for >6 months before initiating ART and initiating ART while pregnant were associated with a reduced risk. CONCLUSIONS: Serving a socioeconomically deprived rural population is not a barrier to successful ART delivery. Patients initiating ART while pregnant and inpatients may require additional counselling and support to reduce LTFU. Providing HIV care for patients not yet eligible for ART may be protective against being LTFU and dying after ART initiation.</td>

      <td>Strengthening health systems through HIV monitoring and evaluation in Sub-Saharan Africa.</td>
      <td>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we describe the challenges faced by using clinical cohorts to perform Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) and the possible solutions for increasing and strengthening health systems in low-income and middle-income countries. RECENT FINDINGS: HIV scale-up has facilitated the transition from paper-based medical records to electronic medical records at hundreds of sites in most of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa and the implementation of national HIV databases. However, National M&E systems in resource-limited settings tend to be chronically challenged by persistently incomplete reporting and inaccurate data, which undermines their usefulness. In low-income and middle-income countries, new information technologies such as Web-based systems and mobile phone networks are expanding rapidly. Their use will improve data quality and, therefore, reduce participant dropout and improve reporting rates. These systems have the potential to allow real time access to summary reports and to integrate data from other settings such as maternal and infant health clinics. SUMMARY: The efforts to address the AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa will require enhanced information systems. Stronger systems are needed to deliver primary healthcare for those with and without HIV, and it is also essential to build and take advantage of synergies across health information systems.</td>

      <td>Risk factors for non-adherence and loss to follow-up in a three-year clinical trial in Botswana.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Participant non-adherence and loss to follow-up can compromise the validity of clinical trial results. An assessment of these issues was made in a 3-year tuberculosis prevention trial among HIV-infected adults in Botswana. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Between 11/2004-07/2006, 1995 participants were enrolled at eight public health clinics. They returned monthly to receive bottles of medication and were expected to take daily tablets of isoniazid or placebo for three years. Non-adherence was defined as refusing tablet ingestion but agreeing to quarterly physical examinations. Loss to follow-up was defined as not having returned for appointments in >/=60 days. Between 10/2008-04/2009, survey interviews were conducted with 83 participants identified as lost to follow-up and 127 identified as non-adherent. As a comparison, 252 randomly selected adherent participants were also surveyed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify associations with selected risk factors. Men had higher odds of being non-adherent (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 2.24; 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.24-4.04) and lost to follow-up (AOR 3.08; 95%CI 1.50-6.33). Non-adherent participants had higher odds of reporting difficulties taking the regimen or not knowing if they had difficulties (AOR 3.40; 95%CI 1.75-6.60) and lower odds associated with each year of age (AOR 0.95; 95%CI 0.91-0.98), but other variables such as employment, distance from clinic, alcohol use, and understanding study requirements were not significantly different than controls. Among participants who were non-adherent or lost to follow-up, 40/210 (19.0%) reported that they stopped the medication because of work commitments and 33/210 (15.7%) said they thought they had completed the study. CONCLUSIONS: Men had higher odds of non-adherence and loss to follow-up than women. Potential interventions that might improve adherence in trial participants may include:targeting health education for men, reducing barriers, clarifying study expectations, educating employers about HIV/AIDS to help reduce stigma in the workplace, and encouraging employers to support employee health.

      <td>Excellent adherence to antiretrovirals in HIV+ Zambian children is compromised by disrupted routine, HIV nondisclosure, and paradoxical income effects.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: A better understanding of pediatric antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence in sub-Saharan Africa is necessary to develop interventions to sustain high levels of adherence. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Adherence among 96 HIV-infected Zambian children (median age 6, interquartile range [IQR] 2,9) initiating fixed-dose combination ART was measured prospectively (median 23 months; IQR 20,26) with caregiver report, clinic and unannounced home-based pill counts, and medication event monitoring systems (MEMS). HIV-1 RNA was determined at 48 weeks. Child and caregiver characteristics, socio-demographic status, and treatment-related factors were assessed as predictors of adherence. Median adherence was 97.4% (IQR 96.1,98.4%) by visual analog scale, 94.8% (IQR 86,100%) by caregiver-reported last missed dose, 96.9% (IQR 94.5,98.2%) by clinic pill count, 93.4% (IQR 90.2,96.7%) by unannounced home-based pill count, and 94.8% (IQR 87.8,97.7%) by MEMS. At 48 weeks, 72.6% of children had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml. Agreement among adherence measures was poor; only MEMS was significantly associated with viral suppression (p = 0.013). Predictors of poor adherence included changing residence, school attendance, lack of HIV disclosure to children aged nine to 15 years, and increasing household income. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Adherence among children taking fixed-dose combination ART in sub-Saharan Africa is high and sustained over two years. However, certain groups are at risk for treatment failure, including children with disrupted routines, no knowledge of their HIV diagnosis among older children, and relatively high household income, possibly reflecting greater social support in the setting of greater poverty.</td>

      <td>Antiretroviral drug resistance--implications for HIV/AIDS reduction in sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The introduction of the highly active antiretroviral therapy in the mid-1990s has significantly reduced morbidities and prolonged the lifespan of people living with HIV. However, the emergence of resistance to the antiretroviral drugs is becoming a major cause of treatment failure. While the problem of drug resistance is being tackled in developed countries, not much seem to be done in this regard in developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. This review looked at the regional distribution of HIV groups and subtypes and how this has affected the pattern of antiretroviral resistance. METHODS: The review was sourced from papers presented at international conferences on HIV/AIDS and rational drug use, relevant journals and Medline search using the keywords--Antiretroviral drugs, drug resistance, HIV subtypes and resistance testing. RESULTS: The types, groups, subtypes, sub-subtypes and recombinant forms of HIV-1 have been identified according to their geographical distributions. The evolution of HIV viral mutations, process (es) involved in development of primary and secondary antiretroviral drug resistance, including the role of HIV genetic polymorphisms, and transmitted resistance have been discussed. CONCLUSION: The pitfalls in the current resistance testing based on HIV-1 subtype B have been highlighted. The design of resistance testing algorithm based on HIV-1 subtype non-B has been suggested for the developing world.</td>

      <td>Implementation and outcomes of an active defaulter tracing system for HIV, prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT), and TB patients in Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya.</td>
      <td>Retention of patients in long term care and adherence to treatment regimens are a constant challenge for HIV, prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT), and TB programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. This study describes the implementation and outcomes of an active defaulter tracing system used to reduce loss to follow-up (LTFU) among HIV, PMTCT, TB, and HIV/TB co-infected patients receiving treatment at three Medecins Sans Frontieres clinics in the informal settlement of Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya. Patients are routinely contacted by a social worker via telephone, in-person visit, or both very soon after they miss an appointment. Patient outcomes identified through 1066 tracing activities conducted between 1 April 2008 and 31 March 2009 included: 59.4% returned to the clinic, 9.0% unable to return to clinic, 6.3% died, 4.7% refused to return to clinic, 4.5% went to a different clinic, and 0.8% were hospitalized. Fifteen percent of patients identified for tracing could not be contacted. LTFU among all HIV patients decreased from 21.2% in 2006 to 11.5% in 2009. An active defaulter tracing system is feasible in a resource poor setting, solicits feedback from patients, retains a mobile population of patients in care, and reduces LTFU among HIV, PMTCT, and TB patients.</td>

      <td>Feasibility, diagnostic accuracy, and effectiveness of decentralised use of the Xpert MTB/RIF test for diagnosis of tuberculosis and multidrug resistance: a multicentre implementation study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The Xpert MTB/RIF test (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) can detect tuberculosis and its multidrug-resistant form with very high sensitivity and specificity in controlled studies, but no performance data exist from district and subdistrict health facilities in tuberculosis-endemic countries. We aimed to assess operational feasibility, accuracy, and effectiveness of implementation in such settings. METHODS: We assessed adults (>/=18 years) with suspected tuberculosis or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis consecutively presenting with cough lasting at least 2 weeks to urban health centres in South Africa, Peru, and India, drug-resistance screening facilities in Azerbaijan and the Philippines, and an emergency room in Uganda. Patients were excluded from the main analyses if their second sputum sample was collected more than 1 week after the first sample, or if no valid reference standard or MTB/RIF test was available. We compared one-off direct MTB/RIF testing in nine microscopy laboratories adjacent to study sites with 2-3 sputum smears and 1-3 cultures, dependent on site, and drug-susceptibility testing. We assessed indicators of robustness including indeterminate rate and between-site performance, and compared time to detection, reporting, and treatment, and patient dropouts for the techniques used. FINDINGS: We enrolled 6648 participants between Aug 11, 2009, and June 26, 2010. One-off MTB/RIF testing detected 933 (90.3%) of 1033 culture-confirmed cases of tuberculosis, compared with 699 (67.1%) of 1041 for microscopy. MTB/RIF test sensitivity was 76.9% in smear-negative, culture-positive patients (296 of 385 samples), and 99.0% specific (2846 of 2876 non-tuberculosis samples). MTB/RIF test sensitivity for rifampicin resistance was 94.4% (236 of 250) and specificity was 98.3% (796 of 810). Unlike microscopy, MTB/RIF test sensitivity was not significantly lower in patients with HIV co-infection. Median time to detection of tuberculosis for the MTB/RIF test was 0 days (IQR 0-1), compared with 1 day (0-1) for microscopy, 30 days (23-43) for solid culture, and 16 days (13-21) for liquid culture. Median time to detection of resistance was 20 days (10-26) for line-probe assay and 106 days (30-124) for conventional drug-susceptibility testing. Use of the MTB/RIF test reduced median time to treatment for smear-negative tuberculosis from 56 days (39-81) to 5 days (2-8). The indeterminate rate of MTB/RIF testing was 2.4% (126 of 5321 samples) compared with 4.6% (441 of 9690) for cultures. INTERPRETATION: The MTB/RIF test can effectively be used in low-resource settings to simplify patients' access to early and accurate diagnosis, thereby potentially decreasing morbidity associated with diagnostic delay, dropout and mistreatment.

      <td>Sex differences in antiretroviral treatment outcomes among HIV-infected adults in an urban Tanzanian setting.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between sex and antiretroviral therapy (ART) outcomes in an urban Tanzanian setting. DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis of a cohort of HIV-infected adult men and women on ART enrolled at the Management and Development for Health (MDH)-President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) HIV care and treatment program in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. METHODS: Clinical and immunologic responses to ART were compared between HIV-infected men and women enrolled from November 2004 to June 2008. Cox regression analyses were used to study sex differences with regard to mortality, immunologic failure (WHO, 2006) and loss to follow-up, after adjusting for other risk factors for the outcomes. RESULTS: Four thousand, three hundred and eighty-three (34%) men and 8459 (66%) women were analyzed. Men were significantly more immunocompromised than women at enrollment in terms of stage IV disease (27 vs. 23%, P < 0.001) and mean CD4(+) cell count (123 vs. 136 cells/mul, P < 0.001). In multivariate analyses, men had a significantly higher risk of overall mortality [hazard ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.30, P < 0.001], immunologic nonresponse defined as CD4 cell count less than 100 cells/mul after at least 6 months of initiating ART (hazard ratio 1.74, 95% CI 1.44-2.11, P < 0.001) and loss to follow-up (hazard ratio 1.19, 95% CI 1.10-1.30, P < 0.001) than that in women. Associations did not change significantly when restricting analyses to the period of good adherence for all patients. CONCLUSION: Nonadherence to care and advanced immunodeficiency at enrollment explained only 17% of the inferior mortality in HIV-infected men in this resource-limited setting. Additional study of behavioral and biologic factors that may adversely impact treatment outcomes in men is needed to reduce these sex disparities.</td>

      <td>Improved antiretroviral treatment outcome in a rural African setting is associated with cART initiation at higher CD4 cell counts and better general health condition.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Data on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in remote rural African regions is increasing. METHODS: We assessed prospectively initial cART in HIV-infected adults treated from 2005 to 2008 at St. Francis Designated District Hospital, Ifakara, Tanzania. Adherence was assisted by personal adherence supporters. We estimated risk factors of death or loss to follow-up by Cox regression during the first 12 months of cART. RESULTS: Overall, 1,463 individuals initiated cART, which was nevirapine-based in 84.6%. The median age was 40 years (IQR 34-47), 35.4% were males, 7.6% had proven tuberculosis. Median CD4 cell count was 131 cells/mul and 24.8% had WHO stage 4. Median CD4 cell count increased by 61 and 130 cells/mul after 6 and 12 months, respectively. 215 (14.7%) patients modified their treatment, mostly due to toxicity (56%), in particular polyneuropathy and anemia. Overall, 129 patients died (8.8%) and 189 (12.9%) were lost to follow-up. In a multivariate analysis, low CD4 cells at starting cART were associated with poorer survival and loss to follow-up (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.15-2.75, p=0.009; for CD4<50 compared to >100 cells/mul). Higher weight was strongly associated with better survival (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51-0.76, p<0.001 per 10 kg increase). CONCLUSIONS: cART initiation at higher CD4 cell counts and better general health condition reduces HIV related mortality in a rural African setting. Efforts must be made to promote earlier HIV diagnosis to start cART timely. More research is needed to evaluate effective strategies to follow cART at a peripheral level with limited technical possibilities.</td>

      <td>Keeping adolescent orphans in school to prevent human immunodeficiency virus infection: evidence from a randomized controlled trial in Kenya.</td>
      <td>PURPOSE: We report the findings from a pilot study in western Kenya, using an experimental design to test whether comprehensive support used to keep adolescent orphans in school can reduce risk factors associated with infection with human immunodeficiency virus. METHODS: Adolescent orphans aged 12-14 years (N = 105) in Nyanza Province were randomized to condition, after stratifying by household, gender, and baseline survey report of sexual behavior. The intervention comprised school fees, uniforms, and a "community visitor" who monitored school attendance and helped to resolve problems that would lead to absence or dropout. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations over two time points, controlling for gender and age. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, intervention students were less likely to drop out of school, commence sexual intercourse, or report attitudes supporting early sex. School support also increased prosocial bonding and gender equity attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: After 1 year of exposure to the intervention, we found evidence suggesting that comprehensive school support can prevent school dropout, delay sexual debut, and reduce risk factors associated with infection with human immunodeficiency virus. Further research, with much larger samples, is needed to better understand factors that mediate the association between educational support and delayed sexual debut, and how gender might moderate these relationships.</td>

      <td>Supporting adolescent orphan girls to stay in school as HIV risk prevention: evidence from a randomized controlled trial in Zimbabwe.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: Using a randomized controlled trial in rural eastern Zimbabwe, we tested whether comprehensive support to keep orphan adolescent girls in school could reduce HIV risk. METHODS: All orphan girls in grade 6 in 25 primary schools were invited to participate in the study in fall 2007 (n = 329). Primary schools were randomized to condition. All primary schools received a universal daily feeding program; intervention participants received fees, uniforms, and a school-based helper to monitor attendance and resolve problems. We conducted annual surveys and collected additional information on school dropout, marriage, and pregnancy rates. We analyzed data using generalized estimating equations over 3 time points, controlling for school and age at baseline. RESULTS: The intervention reduced school dropout by 82% and marriage by 63% after 2 years. Compared with control participants, the intervention group reported greater school bonding, better future expectations, more equitable gender attitudes, and more concerns about the consequences of sex. CONCLUSIONS: We found promising evidence that comprehensive school support may reduce HIV risk for orphan girls. Further study, including assessment of dose response, cost benefit, and HIV and herpes simplex virus 2 biomarker measurement, is warranted.</td>

      <td>Fatal toxicity from symptomatic hyperlactataemia: a retrospective cohort study of factors implicated with long-term nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor use in a South African hospital.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In many Sub-Saharan African countries, first-line therapy for HIV may include a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). Long-term NRTI use is associated with symptomatic hyperlactataemia due to inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, a potentially fatal complication. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the factors associated with inhospital fatality for HIV inpatients prescribed NRTIs long term who presented with symptomatic hyperlactataemia. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study at a 900-bed university hospital in South Africa over 4 years (2005-2008). We included HIV inpatients prescribed NRTIs long term who presented with symptomatic hyperlactataemia (long-term NRTI use; lactate >4.0 mmol/L; absence of infectious source; symptoms requiring admission). Data included demographics, medical history, NRTI duration, blood pressure, symptom duration and relevant laboratory data. RESULTS: Of 79 patients who met inclusion criteria (mean age 38.2 +/- 10.5 years, 97% female) there were 46 fatalities (58%). Factors significantly associated with fatality were presence of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.04), lactate >/=10 mmol/L (p = 0.003), pH <7.2 (p = 0.002), creatinine >/=200 mumol/L (p = 0.03) and altered mental status (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, NRTI-related symptomatic hyperlactataemia occurred predominantly in females. Mortality was associated with severely elevated lactate (>/=10 mmol/L), the degree of acidosis, elevated creatinine, history of diabetes and altered mental status on presentation.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: To examine the uptake of ART among pregnant women referred to an ART service and the associated rates and risk factors for vertical HIV transmission. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of an observational cohort at a community ART clinic in Cape Town. RESULTS: Between 2002 and 2008, 367 treatment-naive pregnant women accessed the clinic. The median age was 27.5 years, and median gestation at presentation was 28 weeks. The median baseline CD4 count and viral load were 134 cells/microl and 28 282 copies/ml. Two hundred and sixty-five women (72%) commenced ART before giving birth, 73 women (20%) were referred for prevention of mother-to-child transmission therapy (PMTCT), and 29 (8%) received no intervention. Among ART-eligible women, 13% were lost to follow-up. Of those starting ART, median duration of therapy prior to birth was 7.6 weeks (interquartile range (IQR) 4 - 11.9).The HIV transmission rate was 5.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.8 - 9.0%). Factors associated with transmission were advanced maternal WHO disease stage (odds ratio (OR) 9.57, p=0.02), and follow-up viral load above 50 copies/ml (OR 3.64, p=0.03). Each additional week on ART reduced transmission by 20% (p=0.05). There was no HIV transmission among women who received more than 8 weeks' therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of HIV transmission in this study was higher than reported in high-income countries. Prevention of vertical transmission with ART was hindered by women presenting late in pregnancy and with advanced stage of HIV disease. Interventions that facilitate earlier ART commencement and improve programmatic retention of pregnant women are required.</td>

      <td>Adherence to drug-refill is a useful early warning indicator of virologic and immunologic failure among HIV patients on first-line ART in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Affordable strategies to prevent treatment failure on first-line regimens among HIV patients are essential for the long-term success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa. WHO recommends using routinely collected data such as adherence to drug-refill visits as early warning indicators. We examined the association between adherence to drug-refill visits and long-term virologic and immunologic failure among non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) recipients in South Africa. METHODS: In 2008, 456 patients on NNRTI-based ART for a median of 44 months (range 12-99 months; 1,510 person-years) were enrolled in a retrospective cohort study in Soweto. Charts were reviewed for clinical characteristics before and during ART. Multivariable logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis assessed associations with virologic (two repeated VL>50 copies/ml) and immunologic failure (as defined by WHO). RESULTS: After a median of 15 months on ART, 19% (n = 88) and 19% (n = 87) had failed virologically and immunologically respectively. A cumulative adherence of <95% to drug-refill visits was significantly associated with both virologic and immunologic failure (p<0.01). In the final multivariable model, risk factors for virologic failure were incomplete adherence (OR 2.8, 95%CI 1.2-6.7), and previous exposure to single-dose nevirapine or any other antiretrovirals (adj. OR 2.1, 95%CI 1.2-3.9), adjusted for age and sex. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the virologic failure rate by month 48 was 19% vs. 37% among adherent and non-adherent patients respectively (logrank p value = 0.02). CONCLUSION: One in five failed virologically after a median of 15 months on ART. Adherence to drug-refill visits works as an early warning indicator for both virologic and immunologic failure.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify the vital status and reasons for children becoming loss to follow-up (LTFU) from a large program in western Kenya. METHODS: This was a prospective evaluation of a random sample of 30% of HIV-exposed and HIV-positive children LTFU from either an urban or rural HIV Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare clinic. LTFU is defined as absence from clinic for >6 months if on combination antiretroviral therapy and > 12 months if not. Experienced community health workers were engaged to locate them. RESULTS: There were 97 children sampled (78 urban, 19 rural). Of these, 82% were located (78% urban, 100% rural). Among the HIV positive, 16% of the children were deceased, and 16% had not returned to clinic because of disclosure issues/discrimination in the family or community. Among the HIV exposed, 30% never returned to care because their guardians either had not disclosed their own HIV status or were afraid of family/community stigma related to their HIV status or that of the child. Among children whose HIV status was unknown, 29% of those found had actually died, and disclosure/discrimination accounted for 14% of the reasons for becoming LTFU. Other reasons included believing the child was healed by faith or through the use of traditional medicine (7%), transport costs (6%), and transferring care to other programs or clinics (8%). CONCLUSION: After locating >80% of the children in our sample, we identified that mortality and disclosure issues including fear of family or community discrimination were the most important reasons why these children became LTFU.</td>

      <td>A randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of counseling and alarm device on HAART adherence and virologic outcomes.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Behavioral interventions that promote adherence to antiretroviral medications may decrease HIV treatment failure. Antiretroviral treatment programs in sub-Saharan Africa confront increasing financial constraints to provide comprehensive HIV care, which include adherence interventions. This study compared the impact of counseling and use of an alarm device on adherence and biological outcomes in a resource-limited setting. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A randomized controlled, factorial designed trial was conducted in Nairobi, Kenya. Antiretroviral-naive individuals initiating free highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the form of fixed-dose combination pills (d4T, 3TC, and nevirapine) were randomized to one of four arms: counseling (three counseling sessions around HAART initiation), alarm (pocket electronic pill reminder carried for 6 months), counseling plus alarm, and neither counseling nor alarm. Participants were followed for 18 months after HAART initiation. Primary study endpoints included plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4 count every 6 months, mortality, and adherence measured by monthly pill count. Between May 2006 and September 2008, 400 individuals were enrolled, 362 initiated HAART, and 310 completed follow-up. Participants who received counseling were 29% less likely to have monthly adherence <80% (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-1.01; p = 0.055) and 59% less likely to experience viral failure (HIV-1 RNA >/=5,000 copies/ml) (HR 0.41; 95% CI 0.21-0.81; p = 0.01) compared to those who received no counseling. There was no significant impact of using an alarm on poor adherence (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.65-1.32; p = 0.7) or viral failure (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.53-1.84; p = 1.0) compared to those who did not use an alarm. Neither counseling nor alarm was significantly associated with mortality or rate of immune reconstitution. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive early adherence counseling at HAART initiation resulted in sustained, significant impact on adherence and virologic treatment failure during 18-month follow-up, while use of an alarm device had no effect. As antiretroviral treatment clinics expand to meet an increasing demand for HIV care in sub-Saharan Africa, adherence counseling should be implemented to decrease the development of treatment failure and spread of resistant HIV.</td>

      <td>Prevalence of potential drug-drug interactions involving antiretroviral drugs in a large Kenyan cohort.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Clinically significant drug-drug interactions (CSDIs) involving antiretrovirals are frequent and under-recognized in developed countries, but data are lacking for developing countries. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To investigate the prevalence of CSDIs between antiretrovirals and coadministered drugs, we surveyed prescriptions dispensed in a large HIV clinic in Kenya. Of 1040 consecutive patients screened, 996 were eligible for inclusion. CSDIs were defined as 'major' (capable of causing severe or permanent damage, contraindicated, avoid or not recommended by the manufacturer, or requiring dose modification) or 'moderate' (manufacturers advise caution, or close monitoring, or capable of causing clinical deterioration). A total of 334 patients (33.5%) were at risk for a CSDI, potentially lowering antiretroviral drug concentrations in 120 (12%) patients. Major interactions most frequently involved rifampicin (12.4%, mostly with efavirenz) and azoles (2.7%) whereas moderate interactions were frequently azoles (13%), steroids (11%), and antimalarials (3%). Multivariable analyses suggested that patients at risk for CSDIs had lower CD4 counts (P = 0.006) and baseline weight (P = 0.023) and WHO Stage 3 or 4 disease (P</=0.007). Risk for CSDIs was not associated with particular regimens, although only 116 (11.6%) patients were receiving WHO second line regimens. CONCLUSIONS: One in three patients receiving antiretrovirals in our programme were at risk of CSDIs. Strategies need to be urgently developed to avoid important drug interactions, to identify early markers of toxicity and to manage unavoidable interactions safely in order to reduce risk of harm, and to maximize the effectiveness of mass antiretroviral deployment in Africa.</td>

      <td>Data on the development of antiretroviral drug resistance in HIV-1-infected children receiving protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) are limited. We examined antiretroviral resistance among a cohort of 323 South African HIV-infected children <2 years old exposed to nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Ritonavir (RTV) was used initially for 138 children who were <6 months old or receiving antimycobacterial therapy; otherwise children received lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based ART. HIV-1 population sequencing of the pol gene was conducted on all pretreatment samples and on posttreatment samples for children who did not achieve HIV-1 plasma RNA <400 copies/ml by 52 weeks. Among children in the cohort, 38 died, 22 had <24 weeks follow-up, 209 achieved virologic suppression, and 54 did not. Of 41 children without virologic suppression with posttreatment HIV genotype data available, major resistance mutations were found in 32 (78%): 14 (36%) had PI mutations including V82A, M46I, and L90M; 29 (71%) had M184V/I; and three had NNRTI mutations (K103N, Y181C, and G190A). Among the children who did not achieve virologic suppression, none of the seven children treated exclusively with LPV/r developed PI-related mutations, compared with 14 of 32 (44%) who received RTV-based regimens (p=0.036); PI genotypes were unavailable for two children. Seventy-eight percent of children without virologic suppression developed resistance mutations that impact second-line ART options. Only children who received RTV-based ART developed major PI-related resistance mutations, and use of this regimen should be avoided.</td>

      <td>Glycerol adjuvant therapy in adults with bacterial meningitis in a high HIV seroprevalence setting in Malawi: a double-blind, randomised controlled trial.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Southern Africa has a high incidence of bacterial meningitis in adults, often associated with HIV co-infection. Mortality exceeds 50%, even with appropriate antibiotic therapy, and is not improved with corticosteroids. Glycerol adjuvant therapy reduces long-term morbidity in bacterial meningitis in children, and its use is being promoted. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of glycerol as an adjuvant therapy for adults with bacterial meningitis in Africa. METHODS: The study was done in two phases. First, in an open-label dose-finding study, 45 adult patients with symptoms, signs, and cerebrospinal fluid findings consistent with bacterial meningitis received either 50 mL, 75 mL, or 100 mL of glycerol four times a day for 4 days. We then did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral glycerol in adults with bacterial meningitis. Patients with clinical and cerebrospinal fluid findings suggestive of bacterial meningitis were randomly assigned in blocks of 12 by use of a random number list produced by an independent statistician to receive either glycerol or an equivalent volume of sugar solution. Glycerol and placebo were indistinguishable by colour or taste. The primary outcome was mortality at 40 days, with secondary outcomes including disability and mortality restricted to pneumococcal disease. All patients were analysed for the primary outcome excluding those who were lost to follow-up. This trial is registered at controlled-trials.com, number ISRCTN70121840. FINDINGS: 75 mL glycerol four times a day was the highest tolerated dose, and was used for the main study. 265 patients were assigned treatment: 137 glycerol and 128 placebo. The trial was stopped early on the advice of the data and safety monitoring board after a planned interim analysis. By day 40, 61 (49%) of 125 patients in the placebo group and 86 (63%) of 136 in the glycerol group had died (adjusted odds ratio 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.2, p=0.003). There was no benefit from glycerol for death and disability by day 40, and glycerol did not improve death and disability by day 40 or death at day 40 in patients with proven bacterial disease or pneumococcal disease. Two serious adverse events occurred that were possibly due to the study drug. INTERPRETATION: Oral glycerol therapy cannot be recommended as an adjuvant therapy in adults with bacterial meningitis in resource-poor settings with a high HIV prevalence.

      <td>OBJECTIVE: Evaluations of CD4 cell count and other prognostic factors on the survival of HIV patients in sub-Saharan Africa are extremely limited. Funders have been reticent to recommend earlier initiation of treatment. We aimed to examine the effect of baseline CD4 cell count on mortality using data from HIV patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in Uganda. DESIGN: Observational study of patients aged at least 14 years enrolled in 10 clinics across Uganda for which The AIDS Support Organization (TASO) has data. METHODS: CD4 cell count was stratified into categories (<50, 50-99, 100-149, 150-199, 200-249, 250-299, >/=300 cells/mul) and Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model the associations between CD4 cell count and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 22 315 patients were included. 1498 patients died during follow-up (6.7%) and 1433 (6.4%) of patients were lost to follow-up. Crude mortality rates (CMRs) ranged from 53.8 per 1000 patient-years [95% confidence interval (CI) 48.8-58.8] among those with CD4 cell counts of less than 50, to 15.7, (95% CI 12.1-19.3) among those with at least 300 cells/mul. Relative to a baseline CD4 cell count of less than 50 cells/mul, the risk of mortality was 0.75 (95% CI 0.65-0.88), 0.60 (95% CI 0.51-0.70), 0.43 (0.37-0.50), and 0.41 (0.33-0.51) for those with baseline CD4 cell counts of 50-99, 100-149, 150-249, and >/=250 cells/mul, respectively. CONCLUSION: Earlier initiation of cART is associated with increased survival benefits over deferred treatment.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: South Africa has the greatest burden of HIV-infection in the world with about 5.2 million HIV-infected adults. In 2003, the South African Government launched a comprehensive HIV and AIDS care treatment program supported by the United States in 2004 through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). METHODS: To describe the scale-up and continuation of antiretroviral therapy in South African Government and PEPFAR-supported sites in South Africa, we conducted a retrospective analysis of routinely collected program reporting data, 2005-2009. RESULTS: From 2005 through 2009, the average rate of persons initiated on antiretroviral therapy in PEPFAR-supported South African Government treatment programs increased nearly four-fold from 6,327 a month in 2005-2006 to 24,622 a month in 2008-2009 resulting in an increase from 33,543 patients on continued treatment in April-June 2005 to 631,985 patients in July-September 2009. Of those 631,985 patients receiving treatment, 65% were women. Men were more likely to be lost to follow-up (9.2% vs. 7.8%, PR 1.18, 95% CI 1.17-1.19) and more likely to die (5.6% vs. 4.1%, PR 1.36, 95% CI 1.35-1.37) than women. CONCLUSIONS: Scale-up and continuation of antiretroviral therapy in South Africa has been a remarkable medical accomplishment. Because more women receive and continue treatment, more efforts are needed to treat and retain men.</td>

In the context of non-B subtypes in resource-limited countries, first-line stavudine-containing regimens have been associated with more extensive and complex mutation patterns, compared with subtype B viruses. Whether the extensive and complex NRTI resistance patterns found among African patients failing first-line antiretroviral therapy is explained by viral genetic diversity or by different patient monitoring strategies remains to be elucidated. Emerging multi-NRTI resistance in sub-Saharan Africa would not only compromise second-line treatment options and the success of antiretroviral rollout, but could also contribute to the spread of drug-resistant variants worldwide.</td>

      <td>A biregional survey and review of first-line treatment failure and second-line paediatric antiretroviral access and use in Asia and southern Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: To better understand the need for paediatric second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART), an ART management survey and a cross-sectional analysis of second-line ART use were conducted in the TREAT Asia Paediatric HIV Observational Database and the IeDEA Southern Africa (International Epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS) regional cohorts. METHODS: Surveys were conducted in April 2009. Analysis data from the Asia cohort were collected in March 2009 from 12 centres in Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Data from the IeDEA Southern Africa cohort were finalized in February 2008 from 10 centres in Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe. RESULTS: Survey responses reflected inter-regional variations in drug access and national guidelines. A total of 1301 children in the TREAT Asia and 4561 children in the IeDEA Southern Africa cohorts met inclusion criteria for the cross-sectional analysis. Ten percent of Asian and 3.3% of African children were on second-line ART at the time of data transfer. Median age (interquartile range) in months at second-line initiation was 120 (78-145) months in the Asian cohort and 66 (29-112) months in the southern African cohort. Regimens varied, and the then current World Health Organization-recommended nucleoside reverse transcriptase combination of abacavir and didanosine was used in less than 5% of children in each region. CONCLUSIONS: In order to provide life-long ART for children, better use of current first-line regimens and broader access to heat-stable, paediatric second-line and salvage formulations are needed. There will be limited benefit to earlier diagnosis of treatment failure unless providers and patients have access to appropriate drugs for children to switch to.</td>

      <td>The consequences of post-election violence on antiretroviral HIV therapy in Kenya.</td>
      <td>Over 1000 individuals were killed and 600,000 were displaced during post-election violence (PEV) in Kenya in 2008. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) depends on continuous access to medications which may have been interrupted due to PEV. In a mixed-methods retrospective review, treatment interruption of ART during PEV was measured among 2534 HIV-positive adults attending the Coptic Hope Center for Infectious Diseases in Nairobi, Kenya. Clients experiencing treatment interruption were compared between the PEV period (30 December 2007 to 28 February 2008) and the same time period one year earlier. Treatment interruption was defined as visiting the pharmacy >/=48 hours after antiretrovirals were calculated to have been completed. Despite clinical services remaining open throughout the PEV period, more clients (16.1%) experienced treatment interruption than during the comparison period (10.2%). Mean daily pharmacy visits were significantly lower (87 vs. 104; p < 0.006) and more variable (p = 0.03) during PEV. Among clients present at both periods (n = 1605), the odds of treatment interruption were 71% higher during PEV (95% confidence interval [CI], 34-118%). In multivariate analysis, men (odds ratio [OR], 1.37; 95% CI, 1.07-1.76) and clients traveling >/=3 hours to clinic (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.28-2.71) were significantly more likely to experience treatment interruption. Clients affected by PEV were interviewed about factors associated with treatment interruption using semi-structured methods. Clients described fear, lack of transportation, and violence as contributing to treatment interruption. Widespread violence associated with the 2007 election in Kenya revealed the dependence of HIV patients on a stable civil society and infrastructure to access medications. Without the ability to maintain consistent HIV therapy, some patients face rapid treatment failure. HIV programs should have appropriate contingency plans wherever political instability may occur. Peace may be one of the most effective and most important public health interventions in Africa.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: The OCTANE trial reports superior outcomes of lopinavir/ritonavir vs. nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) among women previously exposed to single-dose nevirapine to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission. However, lopinavir/ritonavir is 12 times costlier than nevirapine. METHODS: We used a computer model, with OCTANE and local data, to simulate HIV-infected, single-dose nevirapine-exposed women in South Africa. Outcomes of three alternative ART sequences were projected: no ART (for comparison), first-line nevirapine, and first-line lopinavir/ritonavir. OCTANE data included mean age (31 years) and CD4 cell count (135/mul); median time since single-dose nevirapine (17 months); and 24-week viral suppression efficacy for first-line ART (nevirapine: 85%, lopinavir/ritonavir: 97%). Outcomes included life expectancy, per-person costs (2008 US$), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: With no ART, projected life expectancy was 1.6 years and per-person cost was $2980. First-line nevirapine increased life expectancy (15.2 years) and cost ($13 990; cost-effectiveness ratio: $810/year of life saved versus no ART). First-line lopinavir/ritonavir further increased life expectancy to 16.3 years and cost to $15 630 (cost-effectiveness ratio: $1520/year of life saved versus first-line nevirapine). First-line lopinavir/ritonavir cost-effectiveness was sensitive to prevalence of nevirapine-resistant virus at ART initiation, time from single-dose nevirapine exposure to ART initiation (6-12, 12-24, or >24 months), second-line ART efficacies, and outcomes after 24 weeks on ART. CONCLUSIONS: First-line lopinavir/ritonavir-based ART is very cost-effective in single-dose nevirapine-exposed, South African women similar to OCTANE participants. Lopinavir/ritonavir should be initiated in women with known nevirapine resistance or single-dose nevirapine exposure less than 12 months prior, or in whom such information is unknown.</td>

      <td>High prevalence of childhood multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in Johannesburg, South Africa: a cross sectional study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the prevalence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), estimated at 0.6-6.7%, in African children with tuberculosis. We undertook a retrospective analysis of the prevalence of MDR-TB in children with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) at two hospitals in Johannesburg, South Africa. METHODS: Culture-confirmed cases of MTB in children under 14 years, attending two academic hospitals in Johannesburg, South Africa during 2008 were identified and hospital records of children diagnosed with drug-resistant TB were reviewed, including clinical and radiological outcomes at 6 and 12 months post-diagnosis. Culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB) was performed using the automated liquid broth MGIT 960 method. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed using the MGIT 960 method for both first and second-line anti-TB drugs. RESULTS: 1317 children were treated for tuberculosis in 2008 between the two hospitals where the study was conducted. Drug susceptibility testing was undertaken in 148 (72.5%) of the 204 children who had culture-confirmed tuberculosis. The prevalence of isoniazid-resistance was 14.2% (n = 21) (95%CI, 9.0-20.9%) and the prevalence of MDR-TB 8.8% (n = 13) (95%CI, 4.8-14.6%). The prevalence of HIV co-infection was 52.1% in children with drug susceptible-TB and 53.9% in children with MDR-TB. Ten (76.9%) of the 13 children with MDR-TB received appropriate treatment and four (30.8%) died at a median of 2.8 months (range 0.1-4.0 months) after the date of tuberculosis investigation. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis in children in Johannesburg in a setting with a high prevalence of HIV co-infection, although no association between HIV infection and MDR-TB was found in this study. Routine HIV and drug-susceptibility testing is warranted to optimize the management of childhood tuberculosis in settings such as ours.</td>

      <td>Correcting mortality for loss to follow-up: a nomogram applied to antiretroviral treatment programmes in sub-Saharan Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization estimates that in sub-Saharan Africa about 4 million HIV-infected patients had started antiretroviral therapy (ART) by the end of 2008. Loss of patients to follow-up and care is an important problem for treatment programmes in this region. As mortality is high in these patients compared to patients remaining in care, ART programmes with high rates of loss to follow-up may substantially underestimate mortality of all patients starting ART. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a nomogram to correct mortality estimates for loss to follow-up, based on the fact that mortality of all patients starting ART in a treatment programme is a weighted average of mortality among patients lost to follow-up and patients remaining in care. The nomogram gives a correction factor based on the percentage of patients lost to follow-up at a given point in time, and the estimated ratio of mortality between patients lost and not lost to follow-up. The mortality observed among patients retained in care is then multiplied by the correction factor to obtain an estimate of programme-level mortality that takes all deaths into account. A web calculator directly calculates the corrected, programme-level mortality with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We applied the method to 11 ART programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. Patients retained in care had a mortality at 1 year of 1.4% to 12.0%; loss to follow-up ranged from 2.8% to 28.7%; and the correction factor from 1.2 to 8.0. The absolute difference between uncorrected and corrected mortality at 1 year ranged from 1.6% to 9.8%, and was above 5% in four programmes. The largest difference in mortality was in a programme with 28.7% of patients lost to follow-up at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: The amount of bias in mortality estimates can be large in ART programmes with substantial loss to follow-up. Programmes should routinely report mortality among patients retained in care and the proportion of patients lost. A simple nomogram can then be used to estimate mortality among all patients who started ART, for a range of plausible mortality rates among patients lost to follow-up.</td>

      <td>Predictors of successful early infant diagnosis of HIV in a rural district hospital in Zambezia, Mozambique.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: A key challenge inhibiting the timely initiation of pediatric antiretroviral treatment is the loss to follow-up of mothers and their infants between the time of mothers' HIV diagnoses in pregnancy and return after delivery for early infant diagnosis of HIV. We sought to identify barriers to follow-up of HIV-exposed infants in rural Zambezia Province, Mozambique. METHODS: We determined follow-up rates for early infant diagnosis and age at first test in a retrospective cohort of 443 HIV-infected mothers and their infants. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with successful follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 443 mother-infant pairs, 217 (49%) mothers enrolled in the adult HIV care clinic, and only 110 (25%) infants were brought for early infant diagnosis. The predictors of follow-up for early infant diagnosis were larger household size (odds ratio [OR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.53), independent maternal source of income (OR, 10.8; 95% CI, 3.42-34.0), greater distance from the hospital (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.01-4.51), and maternal receipt of antiretroviral therapy (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.02-9.73). The median age at first test among 105 infants was 5 months (interquartile range, 2-7); 16% of the tested infants were infected. CONCLUSIONS: Three of four HIV-infected women in rural Mozambique did not bring their children for early infant HIV diagnosis. Maternal receipt of antiretroviral therapy has favorable implications for maternal health that will increase the likelihood of early infant diagnosis. We are working with local health authorities to improve the linkage of HIV-infected women to HIV care to maximize early infant diagnosis and care.</td>

      <td>Density of healthcare providers and patient outcomes: evidence from a nationally representative multi-site HIV treatment program in Uganda.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between density of healthcare providers and patient outcomes using a large nationally representative cohort of patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in Uganda. DESIGN: We obtained data from The AIDS Support Organization (TASO) in Uganda. Patients 18 years of age and older who initiated cART at TASO between 2004 and 2008 contributed to this analysis. The number of healthcare providers per 100 patients, the number of patients lost to follow-up per 100 person years and number of deaths per 100 person years were calculated. Spearman correlation was used to identify associations between patient loss to follow-up and mortality with the healthcare provider-patient ratios. RESULTS: We found no significant associations between the number of patients lost to follow-up and physicians (p = 0.45), nurses (p = 0.93), clinical officers (p = 0.80), field officers (p = 0.56), and healthcare providers overall (p = 0.83). Similarly, no significant associations were observed between mortality and physicians (p = 0.65), nurses (p = 0.49), clinical officers (p = 0.73), field officers (p = 0.78), and healthcare providers overall (p = 0.73). CONCLUSIONS: Patient outcomes, as measured by loss to follow-up and mortality, were not significantly associated with the number of doctors, nurses, clinical officers, field officers, or healthcare providers overall. This may suggest that that other factors, such as the presence of volunteer patient supporters or broader political or socioeconomic influences, may be more closely associated with outcomes of care among patients on cART in Uganda.</td>

      <td>HIV priorities and health distributions in a rural region in Tanzania: a qualitative study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: International and national agencies play a major role in setting HIV care-and-treatment priorities in low-income-countries. Little is known about priority setting at lower health-system levels. The objective of this article is to explore experiences of HIV priority decisions, at what levels these decisions are made and how they might influence the distribution of health benefits in a high-endemic region in Tanzania. METHODS: This is a qualitative study using observations, key documents and semistructured focus-group and individual interviews (43) with health workers, patients and administrators at one regional and one district hospital. The analysis was based on an editing analysis style. RESULTS: Health workers did not perceive themselves as bedside rationing agents and they reported following national recommendations and felt they have little impact on important priority decisions. Health benefit distributions were largely determined by priority decisions made at a national level. External factors, such as eligibility criteria, inadequate funding and barriers to access seemed to play a major role in the actual distribution of health services and benefits in the region. Patient groups who were actually given high priority were the sickest patients, those living near a facility and those who could afford long journeys and frequent visits. Low-priority groups were those experiencing other co-morbidities or treatment failure, children, asymptomatic patients and the poorest. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The interaction of priority setting across health-system levels and their impact on distribution of health outcomes in the population has been underestimated. The distributional pattern of health outcomes calls for further normative assessment.</td>

      <td>Culture conversion among HIV co-infected multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients in Tugela Ferry, South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Little is known about the time to sputum culture conversion in MDR-TB patients co-infected with HIV, although such patients have, historically, had poor outcomes. We describe culture conversion rates among MDR-TB patients with and without HIV-co-infection in a TB-endemic, high-HIV prevalent, resource-limited setting. METHODS: Patients with culture-proven MDR-TB were treated with a standardized second-line regimen. Sputum cultures were taken monthly and conversion was defined as two negative cultures taken at least one month apart. Time-to-conversion was measured from the day of initiation of MDR-TB therapy. Subjects with HIV received antiretroviral therapy (ART) regardless of CD4 count. RESULTS: Among 45 MDR-TB patients, 36 (80%) were HIV-co-infected. Overall, 40 (89%) of the 45 patients culture-converted within the first six months and there was no difference in the proportion who converted based on HIV status. Median time-to-conversion was 62 days (IQR 48-111). Among the five patients who did not culture convert, three died, one was transferred to another facility, and one refused further treatment before completing 6 months of therapy. Thus, no patients remained persistently culture-positive at 6 months of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: With concurrent second-line TB and ART medications, MDR-TB/HIV co-infected patients can achieve culture conversion rates and times similar to those reported from HIV-negative patients worldwide. Future studies are needed to examine whether similar cure rates are achieved at the end of MDR-TB treatment and to determine the optimal use and timing of ART in the setting of MDR-TB treatment.</td>

      <td>Low lopinavir plasma or hair concentrations explain second-line protease inhibitor failures in a resource-limited setting.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: In resource-limited settings, many patients, with no prior protease inhibitor (PI) treatment on a second-line, high genetic barrier, ritonavir-boosted PI-containing regimen have virologic failure. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to investigate the aetiology of virologic failure in 2 public health antiretroviral clinics in South Africa documenting the prevalence of virologic failure (HIV RNA load >500 copies/mL) and genotypic antiretroviral resistance; and lopinavir hair and plasma concentrations in a nested case-control study. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients treated with a second-line regimen including lopinavir boosted with ritonavir were included, of whom 50 (25 cases, with virologic failure and 25 controls) were included in a nested case control study. Of 93 patients, 37 (40%) had virological failure, only 2 of them had had major PI mutations. The negative predictive values: probability of failure with lopinavir plasma concentration >1 microg/mL or hair concentrations >3.63 ng/mg for virologic failure were 86% and 89%, and positive predictive values of low concentrations 73% and 79%, respectively, whereas all virologic failures with HIV RNA loads above 1000 copies per milliliter, of patients without PI resistance, could be explained by either having a low lopinavir concentration in plasma or hair. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients who fail a lopinavir/ritonavir regimen, in our setting, have poor lopinavir exposure. A threshold plasma lopinavir concentration (indicating recent lopinavir/ritonavir use) and/or hair concentration (indicating longer term lopinavir exposure) are valuable in determining the aetiology of virologic failure and identifying patients in need of adherence counselling or resistance testing.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: To assess the degree to which policy changes to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria translate into effective ACT delivery. METHODS: Prospective observational study of drug dispensing practices at baseline and during the 3 years following introduction of ACT with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) plus artesunate (AS) in Rufiji District, compared with two neighbouring districts where SP monotherapy remained the first-line treatment, was carried out. Demographic and dispensing data were collected from all patients at the dispensing units of selected facilities for 1 month per quarter, documenting a total of 271, 953 patient encounters in the three districts. RESULTS: In Rufiji, the proportion of patients who received a clinical diagnosis of malaria increased from 47.6% to 57.0%. A majority (75.9%) of these received SP + AS during the intervention period. Of patients who received SP + AS, 94.6% received the correct dose of both. Among patients in Rufiji who received SP, 14.2% received SP monotherapy, and among patients who received AS, 0.3% received AS monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The uptake of SP + AS in Rufiji was rapid and sustained. Although some SP monotherapy occurred, AS monotherapy was rare, and most received the correct dose of both drugs. These results suggest that implementation of an artemisinin combination therapy, accompanied by training, job aids and assistance in stock management, can rapidly increase access to effective antimalarial treatment.</td>

      <td>Kaposi sarcoma in South African children.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in sub-Saharan Africa, increased tens of times since the onset of the AIDS epidemic. There is, however, very little literature concerning the clinical features of this disease, its management and outcome in HIV-positive children in Africa. This study describes retrospectively the clinical presentation of the malignancy, its management and outcome, in a series of HIV-positive children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy children with KS and HIV infection were admitted consecutively from January 1998 to December 2009 in South African hospitals. Clinical data were extracted from tumor registries and patient records and analyzed. RESULTS: The average age in this series was 73 months. The males/females ratio was 1.59:1. Skin lesions were present in 36 out of 63 cases (57.14%), followed by lymph node lesions (28 cases, 44.44%). The mean CD4+ lymphocyte count was 440 (SD = 385). The average CD4+ percentage was 12.20% (SD = 9.13). Only 14 patients (20%) were taking combined antiretrovirals at the time of diagnosis; a further 35 were given HIV treatment after diagnosis. Thirty-two patients (45.71%) survived only 4 months on average; 10 were lost to follow-up; and 28 (40%) were alive, with an average follow-up of 16 months. Antiretrovirals improved survival (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The often present skin lesions facilitated the diagnosis; lymphadenopathy was less frequently seen than skin lesions. Antiretroviral drugs were associated with higher survival rate. The mortality remains high in spite of antiretrovirals and cytostatics.</td>

      <td>In sub-Saharan Africa, while antiretroviral therapy (ART) becomes widely available, access to biological measurements to monitor patients under ART remains scarce, making the management of ART difficult. We described the management of switching to second-line ART where HIV care is provided mainly in secondary health-care structures, in the region of Segou, Mali. Of 865 patients, followed under ART for a median time of 15 months, 40 switched to second-line ART (3.3 switches/100 person years). Reason for switching was failure in 18 patients (after 21 months in median) and severe intolerance in 13 (after three months in median). Switching to second-line ART occurred earlier when motivated by intolerance than by failure. The low rate of switch compares well with other studies, but was low compared to the expected rate of failure, and may indicate that physicians are reluctant to switch ART when treatment options are limited.</td>

      <td>Predictors of multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in a high HIV prevalence community.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) have emerged in high-HIV-prevalence settings, which generally lack laboratory infrastructure for diagnosing TB drug resistance. Even where available, inherent delays with current drug-susceptibility testing (DST) methods result in clinical deterioration and ongoing transmission of MDR and XDR-TB. Identifying clinical predictors of drug resistance may aid in risk stratification for earlier treatment and infection control. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case-control study of patients with MDR (cases), XDR (cases) and drug-susceptible (controls) TB in a high-HIV-prevalence setting in South Africa to identify clinical and demographic risk factors for drug-resistant TB. Controls were selected in a 1:1:1 ratio and were not matched. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and performed multivariate logistic regression to identify independent predictors. RESULTS: We enrolled 116, 123 and 139 patients with drug-susceptible, MDR, and XDR-TB. More than 85% in all three patient groups were HIV-infected. In multivariate analysis, MDR and XDR-TB were each strongly associated with history of TB treatment failure (adjusted OR 51.7 [CI 6.6-403.7] and 51.5 [CI 6.4-414.0], respectively) and hospitalization more than 14 days (aOR 3.8 [CI 1.1-13.3] and 6.1 [CI 1.8-21.0], respectively). Prior default from TB treatment was not a risk factor for MDR or XDR-TB. HIV was a risk factor for XDR (aOR 8.2, CI 1.3-52.6), but not MDR-TB. Comparing XDR with MDR-TB patients, the only significant risk factor for XDR-TB was HIV infection (aOR 5.3, CI 1.0-27.6). DISCUSSION: In this high-HIV-prevalence and drug-resistant TB setting, a history of prolonged hospitalization and previous TB treatment failure were strong risk factors for both MDR and XDR-TB. Given high mortality observed among patients with HIV and drug-resistant TB co-infection, previously treated and hospitalized patients should be considered for empiric second-line TB therapy while awaiting confirmatory DST results in settings with a high-burden of MDR/XDR-TB.</td>

      <td>Reverse transcriptase inhibitors drug resistance mutations in drug-naive HIV type 1 positive Kenyans.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the extent of HIV-1 drug resistance among drug naive Kenyan individuals. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Kenya Medical Research Institute HIV laboratory Nairobi, Kenya. SUBJECTS: A total of seventy eight HIV-1 positive drug naive subjects randomised from five Kenyan provincial hospitals between April and June 2004. RESULTS: A major non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI) an associated mutation was found in one patient (1.3%). NNRTI associated resistance mutations were present at amino acid codon sites G98A (2.56%); K103E (1.3%) and L100F (3.57%) prevalences. Baseline resistance may compromise the response to standard NNRTI-based first-line ART in 1.3 % of the study subjects. CONCLUSION: This indicates in general, that drug resistance among HIV-1 positive drug naive individual is at low thresholds (1.3%) but the problem could be more serious than reported here. Continuous resistance monitoring is therefore warranted to maintain individual and population-level ART effectiveness.</td>

      <td>Adjusting mortality for loss to follow-up: analysis of five ART programmes in sub-Saharan Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Evaluation of antiretroviral treatment (ART) programmes in sub-Saharan Africa is difficult because many patients are lost to follow-up. Outcomes in these patients are generally unknown but studies tracing patients have shown mortality to be high. We adjusted programme-level mortality in the first year of antiretroviral treatment (ART) for excess mortality in patients lost to follow-up. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Treatment-naive patients starting combination ART in five programmes in Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi and South Africa were eligible. Patients whose last visit was at least nine months before the closure of the database were considered lost to follow-up. We filled missing survival times in these patients by multiple imputation, using estimates of mortality from studies that traced patients lost to follow-up. Data were analyzed using Weibull models, adjusting for age, sex, ART regimen, CD4 cell count, clinical stage and treatment programme. A total of 15,915 HIV-infected patients (median CD4 cell count 110 cells/microL, median age 35 years, 68% female) were included; 1,001 (6.3%) were known to have died and 1,285 (14.3%) were lost to follow-up in the first year of ART. Crude estimates of mortality at one year ranged from 5.7% (95% CI 4.9-6.5%) to 10.9% (9.6-12.4%) across the five programmes. Estimated mortality hazard ratios comparing patients lost to follow-up with those remaining in care ranged from 6 to 23. Adjusted estimates based on these hazard ratios ranged from 10.2% (8.9-11.6%) to 16.9% (15.0-19.1%), with relative increases in mortality ranging from 27% to 73% across programmes. CONCLUSIONS: Naive survival analysis ignoring excess mortality in patients lost to follow-up may greatly underestimate overall mortality, and bias ART programme evaluations. Adjusted mortality estimates can be obtained based on excess mortality rates in patients lost to follow-up.</td>

      <td>Age at menarche, schooling, and sexual debut in northern Malawi.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Age at sexual debut is a key behavioural indicator used in HIV behavioural surveillance. Early age at menarche may precipitate early sex through perceived readiness for sex, or through school drop-out, but this is rarely studied. We investigated trends and circumstances of sexual debut in relation to schooling and age at menarche. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cross-sectional sexual behaviour survey was conducted on all individuals age 15-59 within a demographic surveillance site in Karonga District, Malawi. Time trends were assessed using birth cohorts. Survival analysis was used to estimate the median age at menarche, sexual debut and first marriage. The 25(th) centile was used to define "early" sex, and analyses of risk factors for early sex were restricted to those who had reached that age, and were done using logistic regression. Of the 8232 women and 7338 men resident in the area, 88% and 78%, respectively, were seen, and, 94% and 92% of these were interviewed. The median reported age at first sex was 17.5 for women and 18.8 for men. For women, ages at menarche, sexual debut and first marriage did not differ by birth cohort. For men, age at sexual debut and first marriage decreased slightly in later birth cohorts. For both men and women increased schooling was associated with later sexual debut and a longer delay between sexual debut and first marriage, but the associations were stronger for women. Earlier age at menarche was strongly associated with earlier sexual debut and marriage and lower schooling levels. In women early sexual debut (<16 years) was less likely in those with menarche at age 14-15 (odds ratio (OR) 0.31, 95%CI 0.26-0.36), and >/=16 (OR 0.04, 95%CI 0.02-0.05) compared to those with menarche at <14. The proportion of women who completed primary school was 46% in those with menarche at <14, 60% in those with menarche at 14-15 and 70% in those with menarche at >/=16. The association between age at menarche and schooling was partly explained by age at sexual debut. The association between age at menarche and early sex was not altered by adjusting for schooling. CONCLUSIONS: Women with early menarche start sex and marry early, leading to school drop-out. It is important to find ways to support those who reach menarche early to access the same opportunities as other young women.</td>

      <td>The importance of clinic attendance in the first six months on antiretroviral treatment: a retrospective analysis at a large public sector HIV clinic in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Adherence to care and treatment are essential for HIV-infected individuals to benefit from antiretroviral therapy (ART). We sought to quantify the effects on treatment outcomes of missing visits soon after initiating ART. METHODS: We analyzed data from HIV-infected patients initiating ART at Themba Lethu Clinic, Johannesburg, South Africa, from April 2004 to August 2008. We used log-binomial regression to evaluate the relative risk of missing visits during the first six months of ART on immunological response and virologic suppression. Cox models were used to evaluate the relationship between missed visits and mortality and loss to follow up over 12 months. RESULTS: Of 4476 patients, 65% missed no visits, while 26% missed one visit, 7% missed two and 1.6% missed three or more visits during the first six months on treatment. Patients who missed three or more medical or antiretroviral (ARV) visits had a two-fold increased risk of poor CD4 response by six months, while the risk of failing to achieve virologic suppression by six months increased two- to five-fold among patients who missed two and three or more medical or ARV visits. Adjusted Cox models showed that patients who missed two (HR 2.1; 95% CI: 1.0-4.3) and three or more (HR 4.7; 95% CI: 1.4-16.2) medical visits had an increased risk of death, while those who missed two ARV (HR 3.8; 95% CI: 2.5-5.8) or three or more medical (HR 3.0; 95% CI: 1.1-8.1) visits had an increased risk of loss to follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-five percent of patients missed one or more visits in the first six months on treatment, increasing their risk of poorer outcomes. These patients could be targeted for additional adherence counselling to help improve ART outcomes.</td>

      <td>Cost-effectiveness of antiretroviral regimens in the World Health Organization's treatment guidelines: a South African analysis.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: the World Health Organization (WHO) recently changed its first-line antiretroviral treatment guidelines in resource-limited settings. The cost-effectiveness of the new guidelines is unknown. DESIGN: comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analysis using a model of HIV disease progression and treatment. METHODS: using a simulation of HIV disease and treatment in South Africa, we compared the life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, lifetime costs, and cost-effectiveness of five initial regimens. Four are currently recommended by the WHO: tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz; tenofovir/lamivudine/nevirapine; zidovudine/lamivudine/efavirenz; and zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine. The fifth is the most common regimen in current use: stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine. Virologic suppression and toxicities determine regimen effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: choice of first-line regimen is associated with a difference of nearly 12 months of quality-adjusted life expectancy, from 135.2 months (tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz) to 123.7 months (stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine). Stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine is more costly and less effective than zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine. Initiating treatment with a regimen containing tenofovir/lamivudine/nevirapine is associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1045 per quality-adjusted life year compared with zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine. Using tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz was associated with the highest survival, fewest opportunistic diseases, lowest rate of regimen substitution, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $5949 per quality-adjusted life year gained compared with tenofovir/lamivudine/nevirapine. Zidovudine/lamivudine/efavirenz was more costly and less effective than tenofovir/lamivudine/nevirapine. Results were sensitive to the rates of toxicities and the disutility associated with each toxicity. CONCLUSION: among the options recommended by WHO, we estimate only three should be considered under normal circumstances. Choice among those depends on available resources and willingness to pay. Stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine is associated with the poorest quality-adjusted survival and higher costs than zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine.</td>

      <td>HIV-1 drug resistance testing from dried blood spots collected in rural Tanzania using the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the commercial ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System (Abbott Molecular, Des Plains, IL, USA) can be used in conjunction with dried blood spots (DBS) for clinical monitoring of drug resistance in patients who fail antiretroviral treatment (ART) in rural Tanzania. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients at Haydom Lutheran Hospital with confirmed treatment failure (viral load >1000 copies/mL) of a first-line ART regimen were selected for resistance testing. DBS were stored with desiccant at -20 degrees C for a median of 126 days (range 0-203) and shipped at ambient temperature for 20 days. After manual extraction of nucleic acids, the ViroSeq kit was used for amplification and sequencing. DBS-derived genotypes were compared with those of a plasma-based assay. RESULTS: Seventeen of 36 (47%) DBS specimens were successfully genotyped. Only 2 of 16 (13%) DBS with a viral load <10,000 copies/mL could be amplified, compared with 15 of 20 (75%) DBS with a viral load >10,000 copies/mL (P = 0.001). In samples that yielded a sequence, all 23 clinically significant reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations in plasma were also detected in DBS. One RT mutation was found in DBS only. In the protease region, 77 polymorphisms were found in plasma, of which 70 (91%) were also detected in DBS. Sixteen of 17 (94%) patients had identical resistance profiles to antiretroviral drugs in plasma and DBS. CONCLUSIONS: The ViroSeq kit performed well in patients with a high viral load, but failed to genotype most DBS with a viral load <10,000 copies/mL. In DBS that yielded a genotype, there was high concordance with a plasma-based assay.</td>

      <td>Increased vulnerability of rural children on antiretroviral therapy attending public health facilities in South Africa: a retrospective cohort study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: A large proportion of the 340,000 HIV-positive children in South Africa live in rural areas, yet there is little sub-Saharan data comparing rural paediatric antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme outcomes with urban facilities. We compared clinical, immunological and virological outcomes between children at seven rural and 37 urban facilities across four provinces in South Africa. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of routine data of children enrolled on ART between November 2003 and March 2008 in three settings, namely: urban residence and facility attendance (urban group); rural residence and facility attendance (rural group); and rural residents attending urban facilities (rural/urban group). Outcome measures were: death, loss to follow up (LTFU), virological suppression, and changes in CD4 percentage and weight-for-age-z (WAZ) scores. Kaplan-Meier estimates, logrank tests, multivariable Cox regression and generalized estimating equation models were used to compare outcomes between groups. RESULTS: In total, 2332 ART-naive children were included, (1727, 228 and 377 children in the urban, rural and rural/urban groups, respectively). At presentation, rural group children were older (6.7 vs. 5.6 and 5.8 years), had lower CD4 cell percentages (10.0% vs. 12.8% and 12.7%), lower WAZ scores (-2.06 vs. -1.46 and -1.41) and higher proportions with severe underweight (26% vs.15% and 15%) compared with the urban and rural/urban groups, respectively. Mortality was significantly higher in the rural group and LTFU significantly increased in the rural/urban group. After 24 months of ART, mortality probabilities were 3.4% (CI: 2.4-4.8%), 7.7% (CI: 4.5-13.0%) and 3.1% (CI: 1.7-5.6%) p = 0.0137; LTFU probabilities were 11.5% (CI: 9.3-14.0%), 8.8% (CI: 4.5-16.9%) and 16.6% (CI: 12.4-22.6%), p = 0.0028 in the urban, rural and rural/urban groups, respectively. The rural group had an increased adjusted mortality probability, adjusted hazards ratio 2.41 (CI: 1.25-4.67) and the rural/urban group had an increased adjusted LTFU probability, aHR 2.85 (CI: 1.41-5.79). The rural/urban group had a decreased adjusted probability of virological suppression compared with the urban group at any timepoint on treatment, adjusted odds ratio 0.67 (CI: 0.48-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Rural HIV-positive children are a vulnerable group, exhibiting delayed access to ART and an increased risk of poor outcomes while on ART. Expansion of rural paediatric ART programmes, with future research exploring improvements to rural health system effectiveness, is required.</td>

      <td>Epidemic levels of drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR and XDR-TB) in a high HIV prevalence setting in Khayelitsha, South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Although multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is emerging as a significant threat to tuberculosis control in high HIV prevalence countries such as South Africa, limited data is available on the burden of drug resistant tuberculosis and any association with HIV in such settings. We conducted a community-based representative survey to assess the MDR-TB burden in Khayelitsha, an urban township in South Africa with high HIV and TB prevalence. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among adult clinic attendees suspected for pulmonary tuberculosis in two large primary care clinics, together constituting 50% of the tuberculosis burden in Khayelitsha. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) for isoniazid and rifampicin was conducted using a line probe assay on positive sputum cultures, and with culture-based DST for first and second-line drugs. Between May and November 2008, culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed in 271 new and 264 previously treated tuberculosis suspects (sample enriched with previously treated cases). Among those with known HIV status, 55% and 71% were HIV infected respectively. MDR-TB was diagnosed in 3.3% and 7.7% of new and previously treated cases. These figures equate to an estimated case notification rate for MDR-TB of 51/100,000/year, with new cases constituting 55% of the estimated MDR-TB burden. HIV infection was not significantly associated with rifampicin resistance in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: There is an extremely high burden of MDR-TB in this setting, most likely representing ongoing transmission. These data highlight the need to diagnose drug resistance among all TB cases, and for innovative models of case detection and treatment for MDR-TB, in order to interrupt transmission and control this emerging epidemic.</td>

      <td>Do HIV-Infected Immigrants Initiating HAART have Poorer Treatment-Related Outcomes than Autochthonous Patients in Spain? Results of the GESIDA 5808 Study.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: currently, 12% of the Spanish population is foreign-born, and a third of newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients are immigrants. We determined whether being an immigrant was associated with a poorer response to antiretroviral treatment. METHODS: historical multicenter cohort study of naive patients starting HAART. The primary endpoint was time to treatment failure (TTF) defined as virological failure (VF), death, opportunistic disease, treatment discontinuation (D/C), or missing patient. Secondary endpoints were TTF expressed as observed data (TFO; censoring missing patients) and time to virological failure (TVF; censoring missing patients and D/C not due to VF). A multivariate analysis was performed to control for confounders. RESULTS: a total of 1090 treatment-naive HIV-infected patients (387 immigrants and 703 autochthonous) from 33 hospitals were included. Most immigrants were from Sub-Saharan Africa (28.3%) or South-Central America/Caribbean (31%). Immigrants were significantly younger (34 y vs. 39 y), more frequently female (37.5% vs. 24.6%), with less HCV coinfection than autochthonous patients (7% vs. 31.3%). There were no differences in baseline viral load (4.95 Log(10) vs. 4.98 Log(10)), CD4 lymphocyte count (193.5/microL vs. 201.5/microL), late initiation of HAART (56.4% vs. 56.0%), or antiretrovirals used. Cox-regression analysis (HR; 95%CI) did not show differences in TTF (0.89; 0.66-1.20), TFO (0.95; 0.66-1.36), or TVF (1.00; 0.57-1.78) between immigrants and autochthonous patients. Losses to follow-up were more frequent among immigrants (17.8% vs. 12.1; p=0.009). Sub-Saharan African patients and immigrant females had a significantly shorter TTF. CONCLUSIONS: the response to HAART among immigrant patients was similar to that of autochthonous patients, although they had a higher rate of losses to follow-up. Sub-Saharan Africans and immigrant females may need particular measures to avoid barriers hindering antiviral efficacy.</td>

      <td>Linkage to HIV care and antiretroviral therapy in Cape Town, South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been scaled-up rapidly in Africa. Programme reports typically focus on loss to follow-up and mortality among patients receiving ART. However, little is known about linkage and retention in care of individuals prior to starting ART. METHODOLOGY: Data on adult residents from a periurban community in Cape Town were collected at a primary care clinic and hospital. HIV testing registers, CD4 count results provided by the National Health Laboratory System and ART registers were linked. A random sample (n = 885) was drawn from adults testing HIV positive through antenatal care, sexual transmitted disease and voluntary testing and counseling services between January 2004 and March 2009. All adults (n = 103) testing HIV positive through TB services during the same time period were also included in the study. Linkage to HIV care was defined as attending for a CD4 count measurement within 6 months of HIV diagnosis. Linkage to ART care was defined as initiating ART within 6 months of HIV diagnosis in individuals with a CD4 count </=200 cells/microl taken within 6 months of HIV diagnosis. FINDINGS: Only 62.6% of individuals attended for a CD4 count measurement within 6 months of testing HIV positive. Individuals testing through sexually transmitted infection services had the best (84.1%) and individuals testing on their own initiative (53.5%) the worst linkage to HIV care. One third of individuals with timely CD4 counts were eligible for ART and 66.7% of those were successfully linked to ART care. Linkage to ART care was highest among antenatal care clients. Among individuals not yet eligible for ART only 46.3% had a repeat CD4 count. Linkage to HIV care improved in patients tested in more recent calendar period. CONCLUSION: Linkage to HIV and ART care was low in this poor peri-urban community despite free services available within close proximity. More efforts are needed to link VCT scale-up to subsequent care.</td>

      <td>Long-term adherence to antiretroviral treatment and program drop-out in a high-risk urban setting in sub-Saharan Africa: a prospective cohort study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Seventy percent of urban populations in sub-Saharan Africa live in slums. Sustaining HIV patients in these high-risk and highly mobile settings is a major future challenge. This study seeks to assess program retention and to find determinants for low adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) and drop-out from an established HIV/ART program in Kibera, Nairobi, one of Africa's largest informal urban settlements. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective open cohort study of 800 patients was performed at the African Medical Research Foundation (AMREF) clinic in the Kibera slum. Adherence to ART and drop-out from the ART program were independent outcomes. Two different adherence measures were used: (1) "dose adherence" (the proportion of a prescribed dose taken over the past 4 days) and (2) "adherence index" (based on three adherence questions covering dosing, timing and special instructions). Drop-out from the program was calculated based on clinic appointment dates and number of prescribed doses, and a patient was defined as being lost to follow-up if over 90 days had expired since the last prescribed dose. More than one third of patients were non-adherent when all three aspects of adherence--dosing, timing and special instructions--were taken into account. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that not disclosing HIV status, having a low level of education, living below the poverty limit (US$ 2/day) and not having a treatment buddy were significant predictors for non-adherence. Additionally, one quarter of patients dropped out for more than 90 days after the last prescribed ART dose. Not having a treatment buddy was associated with increased risk for drop-out (hazard ratio 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0-1.9). CONCLUSION: These findings point to the dilemma of trying to sustain a growing number of people on life-long ART in conditions where prevailing stigma, poverty and food shortages threatens the long-term success of HIV treatment.</td>

      <td>Baseline severe anaemia should not preclude use of zidovudine in antiretroviral-eligible patients in resource-limited settings.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Stavudine is no longer recommended as part of first-line therapy for patients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Uganda. Most patients are currently initiated on zidovudine-containing regimens, which can induce anaemia. We investigated the risk factors for early severe anaemia in the first six months of ART initiation. METHODS: We defined baseline (ART initiation) anaemia as haemoglobin (Hb) </=9.5 g/dL, baseline severe anaemia as Hb </=8 g/dL, and early severe anaemia as Hb </=8 g/dL within six months of ART initiation. Risk factors for the development of early severe anaemia were analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: In total, 5494 patients initiated ART, 821 (15%) had baseline anaemia, and 296 (5%) had baseline severe anaemia. Early severe anaemia occurred in 109 (4%) of 3105 patients who had at least one Hb measurement in the first six months on ART. Patients with baseline anaemia had a larger increase in Hb (median g/dL [IQR]) within the first six months compared with non-anaemic patients (2.9 [1.7, 4.6] vs. 0.7 [-0.2, 1.7], p < 0.0001). Having a new tuberculosis episode OR 3.69 (95% CI 1.64 - 8.32), MCV <80fL OR 1.60 (95% CI 1.01- 2.52) and baseline severe anaemia OR 5.27 (95% CI 3.00 - 9.26) were associated with early severe anaemia. Initiation on a zidovudine-based regimen was not associated with an increased risk of early severe anaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients in an urban HIV clinic in Uganda, severe anaemia is modestly prevalent at ART initiation and improves with ART in the majority of patients. These data suggest that baseline severe anaemia should not be used as a criterion for avoiding the use of zidovudine in patients initiating ART in resource-limited settings.</td>

      <td>Central nervous system disorders after starting antiretroviral therapy in South Africa.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To describe the spectrum of central nervous system (CNS) disease during the first year of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and to determine the contribution of neurological immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). DESIGN: A prospective observational cohort study conducted over a 12-month period at a public sector referral hospital in South Africa. METHODS: HIV-seropositive patients who developed new or recurrent neurological or psychiatric symptom(s) or sign(s) within the first year of starting ART were enrolled. We used the number of patients starting ART in the referral area in the preceding year as the denominator to calculate the incidence of referral for neurological deterioration. Patients with delirium and peripheral neuropathy were excluded. Outcome at 6 months was recorded. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were enrolled. The median nadir CD4(+) cell counts was 64 cells/mul. Fifty-nine percent of the patients were receiving antituberculosis treatment. The incidence of referral for CNS deterioration in the first year of ART was 23.3 cases [95% confidence interval (CI), 18.3-29.2] per 1000 patient-years at risk. CNS tuberculosis (n = 27, 36%), cryptococcal meningitis (n = 18, 24%), intracerebral space occupying lesions (other than tuberculoma) (n = 10, 13%) and psychosis (n = 9, 12%) were the most frequent diagnoses. Paradoxical neurological IRIS was diagnosed in 21 patients (28%), related to tuberculosis in 16 and cryptococcosis in five. At 6 months, 23% of the patients had died and 20% were lost to follow-up. CONCLUSION: Opportunistic infections, notably tuberculosis and cryptococcosis, were the most frequent causes for neurological deterioration after starting ART. Neurological IRIS occurred in over a quarter of patients.</td>

      <td>HIV type-1 drug resistance testing on dried blood spots is feasible and reliable in patients who fail antiretroviral therapy in rural Tanzania.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: HIV type-1 (HIV-1) drug resistance testing is rarely available in resource-limited settings because of high costs and stringent requirements for storage and transport of plasma. Dried blood spots (DBS) can be a convenient alternative to plasma, but the use of DBS needs validation under field conditions. We assessed the performance of DBS in genotypic resistance testing of patients who failed first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in rural Tanzania. METHODS: A total of 36 ART-experienced patients with viral loads >1,000 copies/ml (median 15,180 copies/ml [range 1,350-3,683,000]) and with various HIV-1 subtypes were selected for resistance testing. DBS were stored with desiccant at ambient temperature for a median of 29 days (range 8-89). Samples were amplified using an in-house reverse transcriptase-nested PCR method and sequenced using the ViroSeq assay (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL, USA). DBS-derived genotypes were compared with genotypes from plasma. RESULTS: Overall, 34 of 36 (94%) DBS specimens were successfully genotyped. In the protease region, of 142 polymorphisms found in plasma, 132 (93%) were also detected in DBS. In the reverse transcriptase region, of 57 clinically relevant mutations present in plasma, 51 (89%) were also detected in DBS. A total of 30 of 34 (88%) patients had identical resistance profiles to antiretroviral drugs in plasma and DBS. CONCLUSIONS: Genotyping was successful in the vast majority of DBS specimens stored at ambient temperature for up to 3 months, and there was high concordance between mutations found in DBS and plasma. Our study suggests that DBS can be a feasible and reliable tool to monitor HIV-1 drug resistance in patients on ART in resource-limited settings.</td>

      <td>INTRODUCTION: The latest WHO guidelines recommend initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) at CD4 cell counts less than 350 cells/mul. However, donors and national governments are reluctant to support implementation owing to uncertainty regarding feasibility and relative benefit. Lesotho has supported earlier initiation since 2008. We assessed outcomes comparing early (CD4 cell counts >200 cells/mul) and late (CD4 cell counts </=200 cells/mul) initiation. METHODS: We describe survival probability among patients initiating ART at CD4 cell counts 200 or less and more than 200 cells/mul and assess associations between baseline CD4 cell counts and mortality, morbidity, loss to follow-up and hospitalization using Cox regression adjusting for confounders identified a priori. RESULTS: Our analysis included 1177 patients; median age was 38 years and the majority (67%) were women. Median time on ART for the overall cohort was 506 days (interquartile range 396-608). Five hundred and thirty eight patients initiated ART at a CD4 cell count 200 cells/mul or less (interquartile range 54-160) and 639 patients initiated at CD4 cell count more than 200 cells/mul (interquartile range 238-321). In multivariate analysis, we found that patients initiating at CD4 cell count more than 200 cells/mul were 68% less likely to die (adjusted hazard ratio 0.32, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.50), and 39% less likely to be lost to follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.43-0.87). Initiating ART at CD4 cell count more than 200 cells/mul was also associated with a 27% reduction in the rate of incident morbidity (adjusted hazard ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.65-0.82) and a 63% decreased rate of hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.19-0.73). CONCLUSION: Earlier initiation is feasible in a low resource, high HIV prevalence setting, and provides important benefits in terms of reduced mortality, morbidity, retention and hospitalization. Donors should fully support the implementation of the latest WHO recommendations.</td>

      <td>Impact of drug stock-outs on death and retention to care among HIV-infected patients on combination antiretroviral therapy in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: To evaluate the type and frequency of antiretroviral drug stock-outs, and their impact on death and interruption in care among HIV-infected patients in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a cohort study of patients who initiated combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in three adult HIV clinics between February 1, 2006 and June 1, 2007. Follow-up ended on February 1, 2008. The primary outcome was cART regimen modification, defined as at least one drug substitution, or discontinuation for at least one month due to drug stock-outs at the clinic pharmacy. The secondary outcome for patients who were on cART for at least six months was interruption in care, or death. A Cox regression model with time-dependent variables was used to assess the impact of antiretroviral drug stock-outs on interruption in care or death. Overall, 1,554 adults initiated cART and were followed for a mean of 13.2 months. During this time, 72 patients discontinued treatment and 98 modified their regimen because of drug stock-outs. Stock-outs involved nevirapine and fixed-dose combination zidovudine/lamivudine in 27% and 51% of cases. Of 1,554 patients, 839 (54%) initiated cART with fixed-dose stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine and did not face stock-outs during the study period. Among the 975 patients who were on cART for at least six months, stock-out-related cART discontinuations increased the risk of interruption in care or death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.83; 95%CI, 1.25-6.44) but cART modifications did not (adjusted HR, 1.21; 95%CI, 0.46-3.16). CONCLUSIONS: cART stock-outs affected at least 11% of population on treatment. Treatment discontinuations due to stock-outs were frequent and doubled the risk of interruption in care or death. These stock-outs did not involve the most common first-line regimen. As access to cART continues to increase in sub-Saharan Africa, first-line regimens should be standardized to decrease the probability of drug stock-outs.</td>

      <td>Prevalence of genotypic resistance to antiretroviral drugs in treatment-naive youths infected with diverse HIV type 1 subtypes and recombinant forms in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.</td>
      <td>As human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diversity may have an impact on both vaccine efficacy and drug resistance, it is important to have knowledge of circulating genetic variants. With widespread use of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in Africa, one of the major potential challenges is the risk of emergence of ARV drug-resistant HIV strains. This study aimed to determine the circulating HIV subtypes and recombinant forms, as well as the prevalence of ARV drug resistance mutations, among 75 treatment-naive HIV-infected youths in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Gag (n = 48), partial pol (n = 44), and partial env (n = 35) sequencing was performed; all three regions were sequenced in 26 samples. Evidence of infection with recombinant viruses was found in 12 (46%) participants; AC recombinants were the most commonly detected and they were identified in six (23%) participants. Of individuals infected with nonrecombinant strains, subtype A was most commonly detected in seven (27%) participants, followed by subtype C detected in six (23%) participants and subtype D detected in one (4%) participant. Among the pol sequences from 44 individuals, three (7%) had resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors and four (9%) had nonnucleoside RT inhibitor resistance mutations. Of these, three (7%) individuals were infected with viruses with cross-resistance mutations to both classes of RT inhibitors. These resistant mutations were all associated with drugs currently used in first-line therapy and in the prevention of vertical transmission. This high prevalence of resistance mutations is of considerable concern in apparently drug-naive populations as it may result in treatment failure and the spread of ARV-resistant strains.</td>

      <td>A randomized factorial trial comparing 4 treatment regimens in treatment-naive HIV-infected persons with AIDS and/or a CD4 cell count <200 cells/muL in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Few randomized trials comparing antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens have been conducted in resource-limited settings. METHODS: In the Republic of South Africa, antiretroviral-naive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals >14 years old with a CD4 cell count <200 cells/muL or a prior AIDS diagnosis were randomized to receive efavirenz (EFV) or lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) with either zidovudine (ZDV) plus didanosine (ddI) or stavudine (d4T) plus lamivudine (3TC) in an open-label, 2-by-2 factorial study and followed up for the primary outcome of AIDS or death and prespecified secondary outcomes, including CD4 cell count and viral load changes, treatment discontinuation, and grade 4 events. RESULTS: In total, 1771 persons were randomized and followed up for a median of 24.7 months. AIDS or death occurred in (1) 163 participants assigned EFV and 157 assigned LPV/r (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.84-1.30]) and in (2) 170 participants assigned ZDV+ddI and 150 assigned d4T+3TC (HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.93-1.44]). HIV RNA levels were lower (P < .001) and CD4 cell counts were greater (P < .01) over follow-up for d4T+3TC versus ZDV+ddI. Rates of potentially life-threatening adverse events and overall treatment discontinuation were similar for d4T+3TC and ZDV+ddI; however, more participants discontinued d4T because of toxicity (12.6%) than other treatments (<5%). CONCLUSION: EFV and LPV/r are effective components of first-line ART. The poorer viral and immune responses with ZDV+ddI and the greater toxicity-associated discontinuation rate with d4T+3TC suggest that these treatments be used cautiously as initial therapy.

      <td>Expansion of antiretroviral treatment to rural health centre level by a mobile service in Mumbwa district, Zambia.</td>
      <td>PROBLEM: Despite the Government's effort to expand services to district level, it is still hard for people living with HIV to access antiretroviral treatment (ART) in rural Zambia. Strong demands for expanding ART services at the rural health centre level face challenges of resource shortages. APPROACH: The Mumbwa district health management team introduced mobile ART services using human resources and technical support from district hospitals, and community involvement at four rural health centres in the first quarter of 2007. This paper discusses the uptake of the mobile ART services in rural Mumbwa. LOCAL SETTING: Mumbwa is a rural district with an area of 23 000 km(2) and a population of 167 000. Before the introduction of mobile services, ART services were provided only at Mumbwa District Hospital. RELEVANT CHANGES: The mobile services improved accessibility to ART, especially for clients in better functional status, i.e. still able to work. In addition, these mobile services may reduce the number of cases "lost to follow-up". This might be due to the closer involvement of the community and the better support offered by these services to rural clients. LESSONS LEARNT: These mobile ART services helped expand services to rural health facilities where resources are limited, bringing them as close as possible to where clients live.</td>

      <td>BCG vaccination status may predict sputum conversion in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis: a new consideration for an old vaccine?</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Failure to convert (persistent sputum and/or culture positivity) while on antituberculosis (anti-TB) treatment at the end of the second month of anti-TB therapy has been reported to be a predictor of treatment failure. Factors that could be associated with persistent bacillary positivity at the end of the second month after initiation of anti-TB treatment were assessed. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in 754 patients with sputum culture positive pulmonary TB in Mwanza, Tanzania. Information on social demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, BCG scar status, HIV status, CD4+ count, white blood cell count, haemoglobin and sputum culture status was obtained. RESULTS: Factors associated with sputum culture non-conversion at the end of the second month of anti-TB treatment were initial acid-fast bacilli (AFB) culture grading of 3+ (OR 5.70, 95% CI 1.34 to 24.31, p=0.02) and absence of a BCG scar (OR 3.35, 95% CI 1.48 to 7.58, p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Patients with pulmonary TB with no BCG scar and high initial AFB sputum intensity are at risk of remaining sputum culture positive at the end of the second month of anti-TB treatment. These findings reflect a beneficial role for BCG vaccination on sputum conversion which should also be examined in large studies in other areas. The finding of a beneficial role for BCG vaccination on the treatment of pulmonary TB is important for TB control and vaccination programmes.</td>

      <td>Lost to follow up from tuberculosis treatment in an urban informal settlement (Kibera), Nairobi, Kenya: what are the rates and determinants?</td>
      <td>Patients lost to follow up (LTFU) from treatment are a major concern for tuberculosis (TB) programmes. It is even more challenging in programmes in urban informal settlements (slums) with large, highly mobile, impoverished populations. Kibera, on the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya is such a community with an estimated population of 500,000 to 700,000. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), in collaboration with the Kenyan Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation (MPHS), operate three clinics providing integrated TB, HIV and primary health care. We undertook a retrospective study between July 2006 and December 2008 to determine the rate of LTFU from the TB programme in Kibera and to assess associated clinical and socio-demographic factors. Thanks to an innovative 'Defaulter Tracing Programme', patients who missed their appointments were routinely traced and encouraged to return for treatment. Where possible, reasons for missed appointments were recorded. LTFU occurred in 146 (13%) of the 1094 patients registered, with male gender, no salaried employment, lack of family support and positive TB smear at diagnosis found to be significant associations (P value </= 0.05). The most commonly cited reasons for LTFU were relocation from Kibera to 'up-country' rural homes and work commitments.</td>

      <td>Extended antenatal antiretroviral use correlates with improved infant outcomes throughout the first year of life.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of extended antenatal triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) on infant outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using pooled data from health clinics in Malawi and Mozambique from July 2005 to December 2009. METHODS: Computerized records of 3273 HIV-infected pregnant women accessing Drug Resource Enhancement Against AIDS and Malnutrition centers were reviewed. ART regimens consisted of nevirapine-based HAART as of 14-25 weeks gestation until 6 months postpartum. Infant infection was determined at 1, 6 and 12 months of age by branched DNA. RESULTS: A total of 3071 pregnancies resulted in 3148 live births. Lost to follow-up, infant deaths and HIV-1 infection rates at 1 and 12 months were 1.3 and 11.5, 0.8 and 6.7 and 0.8 and 2.0, respectively. Infant HIV-1-free survival at 12 months was 92.5%. Mother-to-child transmission and/or infant deaths correlated with length of maternal antenatal ART by multivariate analysis at 1, 6 and 12 months: 14% in women with more than 30 days of triple antenatal ART and 6.9% in mothers receiving at least 90 days of antenatal ART, P = 0.001. Fifty percent of 54 episodes of transmission occurred in women with higher CD4 cell counts (>350 cells/mul). Infant mortality was 67/1000, lower than background rates (78-100/1000). Growth failure (weight-for-age Z score <-2) was present in 8% of infants around birth, 6% at 6 months, 23% at 12 months (lower than country-specific rates). CONCLUSION: Extended antenatal ART is protective against adverse infant outcomes up to 12 months of age even in children born to mothers with higher CD4 cell counts.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of loss to follow-up in a treatment programme for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Kenya and to investigate how loss to follow-up is affected by gender. METHODS: Between November 2001 and November 2007, 50 275 HIV-positive individuals aged >/= 14 years (69% female; median age: 36.2 years) were enrolled in the study. An individual was lost to follow-up when absent from the HIV treatment clinic for > 3 months if on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) or for > 6 months if not. The incidence of loss to follow-up was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods and factors associated with loss to follow-up were identified by logistic and Cox multivariate regression analysis. FINDINGS: Overall, 8% of individuals attended no follow-up visits, and 54% of them were lost to follow-up. The overall incidence of loss to follow-up was 25.1 per 100 person-years. Among the 92% who attended at least one follow-up visit, the incidence of loss to follow-up before and after starting cART was 27.2 and 14.0 per 100 person-years, respectively. Baseline factors associated with loss to follow-up included younger age, a long travel time to the clinic, patient disclosure of positive HIV status, high CD4+ lymphocyte count, advanced-stage HIV disease, and rural clinic location. Men were at an increased risk overall and before and after starting cART. CONCLUSION: The risk of being lost to follow-up was high, particularly before starting cART. Men were more likely to become lost to follow-up, even after adjusting for baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Interventions designed for men and women separately could improve retention.</td>

      <td>PURPOSE: In resource-limited settings, there are only a few antiretroviral treatment (ART) options. Our objective was to evaluate the reasons for first-line ART changes in resource-limited settings. METHODS: Prospective research cohort of patients initiating ART between April 2004 and April 2005 in Kampala, Uganda. The main endpoint was the substitution of at least 1 drug included in the initial combination. RESULTS: Five hundred Fifty-nine patients initiated on ART, 70% were female, median CD4+ count 98 (21-163) cells per microliter, median HIV RNA log(1)(0) 5.4 (5.0-5.8). 413 (74%) patients were started on stavudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine, and 146 (36%) on zidovudine, lamivudine and efavirenz. One hundred Forty-eight (26.5%) had at least one treatment change (incidence rate 14.3 per 100 person-years; confidence interval: 12.2 to 16.9). The main reason for first treatment change was drug toxicity (n = 91, 61.5%). Stavudine accounted for the majority of the toxicities that led to drug substitution (n = 76, 84%). In the multivariate analysis, being female (P = 0.011) and being stage 3-4 as compared with 1-2 at ART initiation were predictive of stavudine substitution (P = 0.05). There was no difference in virologic outcome in patients who changed due to toxicity compared with those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the treatment changes were due to stavudine-related toxicity. Long-term stavudine use is less well tolerated in women.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: Improving the way artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is provided to patients attending clinics is critical to maximize the benefit of this new medicine. In 2007, a new initiative was launched in one part of Kenya to improve malaria case-management through enhanced in-service training and provision of job aids. METHODS: An evaluation of the intervention using pre- and post-intervention cross sectional health facility surveys was conducted in Bondo district. The surveys included: audit of government health facilities, health worker structured interviews and exit interviews with caretakers of sick children below five years of age. The outcome indicators were the proportions of febrile children who had AL prescribed, AL dispensed, and four different dispensing and counseling tasks performed. RESULTS: At baseline 33 government health facilities, 48 health workers and 386 febrile child consultations were evaluated. At follow-up the same health facilities were surveyed and 36 health workers and 390 febrile child consultations evaluated. The findings show: 1) no health facility or health worker was exposed to all components of the intervention; 2) the proportion of health workers who received the enhanced in-service training was 67%; 3) the proportion of febrile children with uncomplicated malaria treated with the first-line anti-malarial drug, artemether-lumefantrine (AL), at health facilities where AL was in stock increased from 76.9% (95%CI: 69.4, 83.1) to 87.6% (95% CI: 82.5, 91.5); 4) there were modest but non-significant improvements in dispensing and counseling practices; and 5) when the analyses were restricted to health workers who received the enhanced in-service training and/or had received new guidelines and job aids, no significant improvements in reported case-management tasks were observed compared to baseline. CONCLUSION: In-service training and provision of job aids alone may not be adequate to improve the prescribing, dispensing and counseling tasks necessary to change malaria case-management practices and the inclusion of supervision and post-training follow-up should be considered in future clinical practice change initiatives.</td>

      <td>Antiretroviral drug resistance--implications for HIV/AIDS reduction in sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The introduction of the highly active antiretroviral therapy in the mid-1990s has significantly reduced morbidities and prolonged the lifespan of people living with HIV However, the emergence of resistance to the antiretroviral drugs is becoming a major cause of treatment failure. While the problem of drug resistance is being tackled in developed countries, not much seem to be done in this regard in developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. This review looked at the regional distribution of HIV groups and subtypes and how this has affected the pattern of antiretroviral resistance. METHODS: The review was sourced from papers presented at international conferences on HIV/AIDS and rational drug use, relevant journals and Medline search using the keywords-Antiretroviral drugs, drug resistance, HIV subtypes and resistance testing. RESULTS: The types, groups, subtypes, sub-subtypes and recombinant forms of HIV-1 have been identified according to their geographical distributions. The evolution of HIV viral mutations, process (es) involved in development of primary and secondary antiretroviral drug resistance, including the role of HIV genetic polymorphisms, and transmitted resistance have been discussed. CONCLUSION: The pitfalls in the current resistance testing based on HIV-1 subtype B have been highlighted. The design of resistance testing algorithm based on HIV-1 subtype non-B has been suggested for the developing world.</td>

      <td>Using a file audit to evaluate retention in care and patient outcomes in a programme to decentralise antiretroviral treatment to primary health care facilities in a high prevalence setting in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.</td>
      <td>HIV care and antiretroviral treatment (ART) provision is largely hospital-based with an over-reliance on doctors. Existing ART sites are reaching capacity and are increasingly unable to initiate new patients and also see follow up patients. In response, the Reproductive Health and HIV Research Unit (RHRU), has supported the KwaZulu-Natal provincial Department of Health with developing a model to decentralise services to primary health care (PHC) level. The programme has been in operation since 2006, and currently nine ART initiation sites down refer stable patients to 24 PHC clinics. Data on patient numbers, treatment outcomes and patient retention rates were collected through a file audit of 2071 adult patient files and analyzed. Results indicate that a file audit is a feasible mechanism to provide this data and can be used to identify gaps and improve quality of care. PHC sites in resource-constrained settings are able to manage stable patients on ART; however, sites need support with monitoring and evaluation and with tracking patients that have been down referred. In terms of quality of care, PHC sites need to ensure that clients receive CD4 count tests and viral load monitoring at six monthly intervals to ensure that treatment failure does not go undetected. Patients suspected of experiencing adverse events or treatment failure appear to be managed according to standard operating procedures, but there is a need to ensure that adverse events are clearly documented in patient files.</td>

      <td>Population-based monitoring of HIV drug resistance in Namibia with early warning indicators.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) testing is not routinely available in many resource-limited settings, therefore, antiretroviral therapy (ART) program and site factors known to be associated with HIVDR should be monitored to optimize the quality of patient care and minimize the emergence of preventable HIVDR. METHODS: In 2009, Namibia selected 5 World Health Organization Early Warning Indicators (EWIs) and piloted abstraction at 9 ART sites: "ART prescribing practices, patients lost to follow-up at 12 months, patient retention on first-line ART at 12 months, on-time antiretroviral drug pick-up, and antiretroviral drug-supply continuity". RESULTS: Records supported monitoring of 3 of 5 selected EWIs. Nine of 9 (100%) sites met the target of 100% initiated on appropriate first-line regimens. Eight of 9 (89%) sites met the target of </=20% lost to follow-up, although 20.8% of ART starters (range: 4.6%-44.6%) had a period of absence without documented ART coverage of 2.3 months (range: 1.5-3.9 months). Six of 9 (67%) sites met the target of 0% switched to a second-line regimen. CONCLUSIONS: EWI monitoring directly resulted in public health action which will optimize the quality of care, specifically the strengthening of ART record systems permitting monitoring of 5 EWIs in future years and protocols for improved ART patient defaulter tracing.</td>

      <td>Reuse of nevirapine in exposed HIV-infected children after protease inhibitor-based viral suppression: a randomized controlled trial.</td>
      <td>CONTEXT: Protease inhibitor (PI)-based therapy is recommended for infants infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who were exposed to nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. However, there are limitations of continuing PI-based therapy indefinitely and reuse of nevirapine has many advantages. OBJECTIVE: To test whether nevirapine-exposed infants who initially achieve viral suppression with PI-based therapy can maintain viral suppression when switched to nevirapine-based therapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized trial conducted between April 2005 and May 2009 at a hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa, among 195 children who achieved viral suppression less than 400 copies/mL for 3 or more months from a cohort of 323 nevirapine-exposed children who initiated PI-based therapy before 24 months of age. INTERVENTIONS: Control group children continued to receive ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, stavudine, and lamivudine (n = 99). Switch group children substituted nevirapine for ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (n = 96). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Children were followed up for 52 weeks after randomization. Plasma HIV-1 RNA of greater than 50 copies/mL was the primary end point. Confirmed viremia greater than 1000 copies/mL was used as a criterion to consider regimen changes for children in either group (safety end point). RESULTS: Plasma viremia greater than 50 copies/mL occurred less frequently in the switch group (Kaplan-Meier probability, 0.438; 95% CI, 0.334-0.537) than in the control group (0.576; 95% CI, 0.470-0.668) (P = .02). Confirmed viremia greater than 1000 copies/mL occurred more frequently in the switch group (0.201; 95% CI, 0.125-0.289) than in the control group (0.022; 95% CI, 0.004-0.069) (P < .001). CD4 cell response was better in the switch group (median CD4 percentage at 52 weeks, 34.7) vs the control group (CD4 percentage, 31.3) (P = .004). Older age (relative hazard [RH], 1.71; 95% CI, 1.08-2.72) was associated with viremia greater than 50 copies/mL in the control group. Inadequate adherence (RH, 4.14; 95% CI, 1.18-14.57) and drug resistance (RH, 4.04; 95% CI, 1.40-11.65) before treatment were associated with confirmed viremia greater than 1000 copies/mL in the switch group. CONCLUSION: Among HIV-infected children previously exposed to nevirapine, switching to nevirapine-based therapy after achieving viral suppression with a ritonavir-boosted lopinavir regimen resulted in lower rates of viremia greater than 50 copies/mL than maintaining the primary ritonavir-boosted lopinavir regimen.

      <td>OBJECTIVES: This paper examines trends and underlying causes of attrition among volunteer community health workers in home-based care for people living with HIV and AIDS in western Kenya. METHODS: Ethnographic data were collected between January and November 2006 through participant observation, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with 30 CHWs, NGO staff and health care providers and 70 PLWHA. RESULTS: An attrition rate of 33% was observed among the CHWs. The reasons for dropout included: the cultural environment within which CHWs operated; lack of adequate support from area NGOs; poor selection criteria for CHWs; and power differences between NGO officials and CHWs which fostered lack of transparency in the NGOs' operations. CONCLUSIONS: In order to achieve well functioning and sustainable HBC services, factors which influence retention/dropout of CHWs should be addressed taking into account the socio-cultural, programmatic and economic contexts within which CHW activities are implemented.</td>

      <td>Short communication: Severe symptomatic hyperlactatemia among HIV type 1-infected adults on antiretroviral therapy in Cote d'Ivoire.</td>
      <td>Stavudine is no longer recommended for use in first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART), but it remains in high demand worldwide because it is affordable. We report the clinical presentation and incidence of severe hyperlactatemia (SL) in HIV-infected adults who initiated ART between April 2005 and May 2009 in Cote d'Ivoire, West Africa. In a prospective cohort study at the HIV care center affiliated with the National Centre for Blood Transfusion, we used standardized forms to record baseline and follow-up data. We measured serum lactate levels for all adults on ART who showed signs of hyperlactatemia. SL was defined as serum lactate >2.5 mmol/liter. Overall, 806 adults initiated ART. Among the 591 patients (73%) on stavudine-containing regimens, 394 were women (67%); the median pre-ART CD4 count was 150/mm3 and the median body mass index was 20.9 kg/m2. These patients were followed for a median of 28 months. We detected SL only among patients taking stavudine. The incidence of SL was 0.55/100 person-years (PY) (95% CI 0.47-0.63) overall and 0.85/100 PY among women (95% CI 0.75-0.95). Among the eight patients with SL, 100% lost >9% of body weight before diagnosis, 100% had serum lactate >4 mmol/liter (range 4.2-12.1), 50% had pre-ART BMI >25 kg/m2, and three patients died (38%), accounting for 6.4% of deaths among patients taking stavudine. As long as HIV clinicians continue to use stavudine in sub-Saharan Africa, they should watch out for acute unexplained weight loss in patients taking ART, particularly among women and patients with high pre-ART BMI.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: Universal testing and treatment holds promise for reducing the burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in sub-Saharan Africa, but linkage from testing to treatment sites and retention in care are inadequate. METHODS: We developed a simulation of the HIV epidemic and HIV disease progression in South Africa to compare the outcomes of the present HIV treatment campaign (status quo) with 4 HIV testing and treating strategies that increase access to antiretroviral therapy: (1) universal testing and treatment without changes in linkage to care and loss to follow-up; (2) universal testing and treatment with improved linkage to care; (3) universal testing and treatment with reduced loss to follow-up; and (4) comprehensive HIV care with universal testing and treatment, improved linkage to care, and reduced loss to follow-up. The main outcome measures were survival benefits, new HIV infections, and HIV prevalence. RESULTS: Compared with the status quo strategy, universal testing and treatment (1) was associated with a mean (95% uncertainty bounds) life expectancy gain of 12.0 months (11.3-12.2 months), and 35.3% (32.7%-37.5%) fewer HIV infections over a 10-year time horizon. Improved linkage to care (2), prevention of loss to follow-up (3), and comprehensive HIV care (4) provided substantial additional benefits: life expectancy gains compared with the status quo strategy were 16.1, 18.6, and 22.2 months, and new infections were 55.5%, 51.4%, and 73.2% lower, respectively. In sensitivity analysis, comprehensive HIV care reduced new infections by 69.7% to 76.7% under a broad set of assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Universal testing and treatment with current levels of linkage to care and loss to follow-up could substantially reduce the HIV death toll and new HIV infections. However, increasing linkage to care and preventing loss to follow-up provides nearly twice the benefits of universal testing and treatment alone.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVES: To describe the resistance mutations selected by a first-line regimen of zidovudine/lamivudine/tenofovir in the absence of real-time viral load monitoring. DESIGN: A substudy of 300 participants from the Development of Antiretroviral Therapy in Africa trial in Uganda and Zimbabwe, which compared managing antiretroviral therapy with and without laboratory monitoring. METHODS: Stored plasma samples from selected time points were assayed retrospectively for HIV-1 RNA. The pol gene in all baseline samples and those with HIV RNA >1000 copies per milliliter at weeks 24 and 48 were sequenced. RESULTS: The proportion with HIV RNA >1000 copies per milliliter increased from 15% at 24 weeks to 24% at 48 weeks. Eighteen of 31 (58%) genotyped samples at 24 weeks had >/= 1 major nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated mutations compared with 41 of 47 (87%) at 48 weeks. Excluding 1 nonadherent patient, a mean of 2.0 (95% confidence interval: 1.3 to 2.8) thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs) developed between weeks 24 and 48 among 14 patients with HIV RNA >1000 copies per milliliter at both time points. K65R was detected in 8 of 63 (13%) patients and was negatively associated with number of TAMs (P = 0.01) but not viral subtype (P = 0.30). CONCLUSIONS: A high rate of acquisition of TAMs, but not of K65R, among patients with prolonged viraemia was observed. However, most patients were virologically suppressed at 48 weeks, and long-term clinical and immunological outcomes in the Development of Antiretroviral Therapy in Africa trial were favorable.</td>

      <td>Scale-up of a decentralized HIV treatment programme in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: does rapid expansion affect patient outcomes?</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To describe the scale-up of a decentralized HIV treatment programme delivered through the primary health care system in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and to assess trends in baseline characteristics and outcomes in the study population. METHODS: The programme started delivery of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in October 2004. Information on all patients initiated on ART was captured in the programme database and follow-up status was updated monthly. All adult patients (> or = 16 years) who initiated ART between October 2004 and September 2008 were included and stratified into 6-month groups. Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics were compared between the groups. Retention in care, mortality, loss to follow-up and virological outcomes were assessed at 12 months post-ART initiation. FINDINGS: A total of 5719 adults initiated on ART were included (67.9% female). Median baseline CD4+ lymphocyte count was 116 cells/microl (interquartile range, IQR: 53-173). There was an increase in the proportion of women who initiated ART while pregnant but no change in other baseline characteristics over time. Overall retention in care at 12 months was 84.0% (95% confidence interval, CI: 82.6-85.3); 10.9% died (95% CI: 9.8-12.0); 3.7% were lost to follow-up (95% CI: 3.0-4.4). Mortality was highest in the first 3 months after ART initiation: 30.1 deaths per 100 person-years (95% CI: 26.3-34.5). At 12 months 23.0% had a detectable viral load (> 25 copies/ml) (95% CI: 19.5-25.5). CONCLUSION: Outcomes were not affected by rapid expansion of this decentralized HIV treatment programme. The relatively high rates of detectable viral load highlight the need for further efforts to improve the quality of services.</td>

      <td>Secular trends in pediatric antiretroviral treatment programs in rural and urban Zambia: a retrospective cohort study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Since 2003 pediatric antiretroviral treatment (ART) programs have scaled-up in sub-Saharan Africa and should be evaluated to assess progress and identify areas for improvement. We evaluated secular trends in the characteristics and treatment outcomes of children in three pediatric ART clinics in urban and rural areas in Zambia. METHODS: Routinely collected data were analyzed from three ART programs in rural (Macha and Mukinge) and urban (Lusaka) Zambia between program implementation and July 2008. Data were obtained from electronic medical record systems and medical record abstraction, and were categorized by year of program implementation. Characteristics of all HIV-infected and exposed children enrolled in the programs and all children initiating treatment were compared by year of implementation. RESULTS: Age decreased and immunologic characteristics improved in all groups over time in both urban and rural clinics, with greater improvement observed in the rural clinics. Among children both eligible and ineligible for ART at clinic enrollment, the majority started treatment within a year. A high proportion of children, particularly those ineligible for ART at clinic enrollment, were lost to follow-up prior to initiating ART. Among children initiating ART, clinical and immunologic outcomes after six months of treatment improved in both urban and rural clinics. In the urban clinics, mortality after six months of treatment declined with program duration, and in the rural clinics, the proportion of children defaulting by six months increased with program duration. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment programs are showing signs of progress in the care of HIV-infected children, particularly in the rural clinics where scale-up increased rapidly over the first three years of program implementation. However, continued efforts to optimize care are needed as many children continue to enroll in ART programs at a late stage of disease and thus are not receiving the full benefits of treatment.</td>

      <td>Development and application of a broadly sensitive dried-blood-spot-based genotyping assay for global surveillance of HIV-1 drug resistance.</td>
      <td>As antiretroviral therapy (ART) is scaled up in resource-limited countries, surveillance for HIV drug resistance (DR) is vital to ensure sustained effectiveness of first-line ART. We have developed and applied a broadly sensitive dried-blood-spot (DBS)-based genotyping assay for surveillance of HIV-1 DR in international settings. In 2005 and 2006, 171 DBS samples were collected under field conditions from newly diagnosed HIV-1-infected individuals from Malawi (n = 58), Tanzania (n = 60), and China (n =53). In addition, 30 DBS and 40 plasma specimens collected from ART patients in China and Cameroon, respectively, were also tested. Of the 171 DBS analyzed at the protease and RT regions, 149 (87.1%) could be genotyped, including 49 (81.7%) from Tanzania, 47 (88.7%) from China, and 53 (91.4%) from Malawi. Among the 70 ART patient samples analyzed, 100% (30/30) of the Chinese DBS and 90% (36/40) of the Cameroonian plasma specimens were genotyped, including 8 samples with a viral load of <400 copies/ml. The results of phylogenetic analyses indicated that the subtype, circulating recombinant form (CRF), and unique recombinant form (URF) distribution was as follows: 73 strains were subtype C (34%), 37 were subtype B (17.2%), 24 each were CRF01_AE or CRF02_AG (11.2% each), 22 were subtype A1 (10.2%), and 9 were unclassifiable (UC) (4.2%). The remaining samples were minor strains comprised of 6 that were CRF07_BC (2.8%), 5 that were CRF10_CD (2.3%), 3 each that were URF_A1C and CRF08_BC (1.4%), 2 each that were G, URF_BC, and URF_D/UC (0.9%), and 1 each that were subtype F1, subtype F2, and URF_A1D (0.5%). Our results indicate that this broadly sensitive genotyping assay can be used to genotype DBS collected from areas with diverse HIV-1 group M subtypes and CRFs. Thus, the assay is likely to become a useful screening tool in the global resistance surveillance and monitoring of HIV-1 where multiple subtypes and CRFs are found.</td>

      <td>Prognosis of patients with HIV-1 infection starting antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa: a collaborative analysis of scale-up programmes.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Prognostic models have been developed for patients infected with HIV-1 who start combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in high-income countries, but not for patients in sub-Saharan Africa. We developed two prognostic models to estimate the probability of death in patients starting ART in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We analysed data for adult patients who started ART in four scale-up programmes in Cote d'Ivoire, South Africa, and Malawi from 2004 to 2007. Patients lost to follow-up in the first year were excluded. We used Weibull survival models to construct two prognostic models: one with CD4 cell count, clinical stage, bodyweight, age, and sex (CD4 count model); and one that replaced CD4 cell count with total lymphocyte count and severity of anaemia (total lymphocyte and haemoglobin model), because CD4 cell count is not routinely measured in many African ART programmes. Death from all causes in the first year of ART was the primary outcome. FINDINGS: 912 (8.2%) of 11 153 patients died in the first year of ART. 822 patients were lost to follow-up and not included in the main analysis; 10 331 patients were analysed. Mortality was strongly associated with high baseline CD4 cell count (>/=200 cells per muL vs <25; adjusted hazard ratio 0.21, 95% CI 0.17-0.27), WHO clinical stage (stages III-IV vs I-II; 3.45, 2.43-4.90), bodyweight (>/=60 kg vs <45 kg; 0.23, 0.18-0.30), and anaemia status (none vs severe: 0.27, 0.20-0.36). Other independent risk factors for mortality were low total lymphocyte count, advanced age, and male sex. Probability of death at 1 year ranged from 0.9% (95% CI 0.6-1.4) to 52.5% (43.8-61.7) with the CD4 model, and from 0.9% (0.5-1.4) to 59.6% (48.2-71.4) with the total lymphocyte and haemoglobin model. Both models accurately predict early mortality in patients starting ART in sub-Saharan Africa compared with observed data. INTERPRETATION: Prognostic models should be used to counsel patients, plan health services, and predict outcomes for patients with HIV-1 infection in sub-Saharan Africa.

      <td>Long-term outcome of children receiving antiretroviral treatment in rural South Africa: substantial virologic failure on first-line treatment.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Long-term (>12 months follow-up) virologic data of children receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Sub-Saharan Africa are limited. Data from rural areas are especially scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term virologic outcome of a pediatric cohort in rural South Africa. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, observational cohort study, including children who initiated ART at least 1 year before data-analysis. Regular monitoring, including HIV-RNA testing, was performed. Genotypic resistance testing was done for children with virologic failure (HIV-RNA >1000 copies/mL). Logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors of virologic failure. RESULTS: A total of 101 children were included. Median duration since beginning ART was 31 months. Overall patient retention-rate was 76% (77/101), with early mortality being the main cause of attrition (13/24, 54%). Initial immunologic and virologic responses were excellent. However, 38% (31/81) of children subsequently experienced virologic failure. Correlation between virologic failure and immunologic decline was nearly absent. At the time of failure, multiple non-nucleoside reverse transcription inhibitor-associated mutations were observed in 52% (12/23) of children. No definite predictors of virologic failure could be determined. CONCLUSIONS: ART provides significant benefits for children in this rural African setting, but the finding that a large proportion of children had virologic failure and developed major drug-resistance mutations on first-line ART is worrying. Causes of failure need to be analyzed and effective prevention strategies are needed. Because of the lack of a correlation between immunologic and virologic failure, treatment failure generally stays unnoticed in settings where HIV-RNA testing is not available.</td>

      <td>Case series of the long-term psychosocial impact of drug-resistant tuberculosis in HIV-negative medical doctors.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Health care workers (HCWs) are at greater risk for tuberculosis (TB), including multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), compared to the general population. The psychosocial impact of nosocomial TB on HCWs has received little attention in the literature. METHODS: A retrospective medical record review from 1999 to 2003 found 15 HCWs who were treated for drug-resistant TB at a specialist hospital in South Africa. Five human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative doctors with no predisposing factors for drug resistance are included in this case series. We collectively present their clinical case histories based on medical records from 2000 to 2005, and explore the long-term psychosocial impact of TB from interviews conducted in 2009. RESULTS: Four doctors had primary MDR-TB and one had primary resistance to multiple first-line drugs. Time from symptom onset to commencement of effective treatment ranged from 8 to 39 weeks. Time for bacteriological confirmation of drug-resistant TB ranged from 6 to 24 weeks. All were cured within 3 years of initial presentation. Content analysis of follow-up interviews revealed five main themes: 1) prolonged morbidity, 2) psychological impact, 3) poor infection control, 4) weak support structures and 5) attrition from the field. CONCLUSION: Themes emergent from this case series encourage prioritisation of TB infection control education and practice to minimise HCW morbidity and prevent HCW attrition from high-burden resource-constrained settings.</td>

      <td>Genetic characterization of HIV type 1 among patients with suspected immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome after initiation of antiretroviral therapy in Kenya.</td>
      <td>Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved the survival of HIV patients but is also associated with unique manifestations of disease in some subjects during the initial months of therapy. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a disorder among individuals starting ART, with no evidence-based treatment and management guidelines. We characterized HIV-1 and determined drug resistance among 14 Kenyan patients with suspected IRIS after ART initiation in 2005. Polymerase chain reaction, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis of viral pol and env showed the following HIV-1 subtypes: A1/A1/A1 (pol-RT/gp41/C2V3), 5; A1/C/A1, 1; A1/D/A1, 2; D/A1/A1, 1; D/C/A1, 1; D/D/A1, 2; D/D/D, 1; and D/A1/A2, 1. Three patients had viruses with major drug resistance-associated mutations. These included nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) mutations: M41L, K65R, D67N, K70R, M184V, and K219Q, and nonnucleoside RTI mutations: K101P, L100I, K103N, and Y181C. Twelve patients harbored viruses that are predicted to use chemokine coreceptor 5 (CCR5) whereas two had variant viruses predicted to use the CXCR4 coreceptor. Drug resistance may not be the only cause of ART adverse events. HIV-1 characterization would be important before and during HIV therapy to avoid treatment failure.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of decentralization (DC) of antiretroviral therapy (ART) provision in a rural district of Malawi using an integrated primary care model. METHODS: Between October 2004 and December 2008, 8093 patients (63% women) were registered for ART. Of these, 3440 (43%) were decentralized to health centres for follow-up ART care. We applied multivariate regression analysis that adjusted for sex, age, clinical stage at initiation, type of regimen, presence of side effects because of ART, and duration of treatment and follow-up at site of analysis. RESULTS: Patients managed at health centres had lower mortality [adjusted OR 0.19 (95% C.I. 0.15-0.25)] and lower loss to follow-up (defaulted from treatment) [adjusted OR 0.48 (95% C.I. 0.40-0.58)]. During the first 10 months of follow-up, those decentralized to health centres were approximately 60% less likely to default than those not decentralized; and after 10 months of follow-up, 40% less likely to default. DC was significantly associated with a reduced risk of death from 0 to 25 months of follow-up. The lower mortality may be explained by the selection of stable patients for DC, and the mentorship and supportive supervision of lower cadre health workers to identify and refer complicated cases. CONCLUSION: Decentralization of follow-up ART care to rural health facilities, using an integrated primary care model, appears a safe and effective way to rapidly scale-up ART and improves both geographical equity in access to HIV-related services and adherence to ART.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: To date, data regarding the determinants of mortality in HIV-infected patients starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Africa have been primarily derived from routine clinical care settings practicing the public health approach. Losses to follow-up, however, are high in these settings and may lead to bias in understanding the determinants of mortality. METHODS: We evaluated HIV-infected adults initiating ART between January 1, 2004 and September 30th, 2007 in an ART clinic in southwestern Uganda. Clinical and demographic characteristics were obtained through routine clinical care. In evaluating determinants of mortality, a 'naive' analysis used only deaths known through routine processes. A 'sample-corrected' approach incorporated, through probability weights, outcomes from a representative sample of patients lost to follow-up whose vital status was ascertained through tracking in the community. RESULTS: In 3,628 patients followed for up to 3.75 years after ART initiation, the 'naive' approach identified male sex and lower pre-ART CD4 count as independent determinants of mortality. The 'sample-corrected' approach found lower pre-ART CD4 count, older age, lower weight and calendar year of ART initiation, but not male sex, to be independent determinants of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Analyses to identify determinants of mortality in HIV-infected patients on ART in Africa that do not account for losses to follow-up can identify spurious associations and miss actual relationships - both with the potential to mislead public health efforts. A sampling-based approach to account for losses to follow-up represents a feasible and potentially scalable method to strengthen the evidence available for implementation of ART delivery in Africa.</td>

      <td>Why are antiretroviral treatment patients lost to follow-up? A qualitative study from South Africa.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: To better understand the reasons why patients default from antiretroviral treatment (ART) programmes to help design interventions that improve treatment retention and ultimately, patient outcomes. METHODS: Prospective cohort study at two treatment sites in South Africa followed by qualitative interviews with patients that had defaulted. RESULTS: Respondents overwhelmingly reported that ART improved their health status and quality of life. Nevertheless, despite improved health from taking ART and worse health when treatment is stopped, serious barriers to treatment remained: transport costs, time needed for treatment, and logistical challenges were barriers to treatment, whereas stigma around HIV/AIDS, and side effects associated with ART were less influential. CONCLUSION: With a better understanding of the reasons for defaulting, interventions can be designed that improve treatment retention and ultimately, patient outcomes. This study argues for realistic interventions and policy changes designed to reduce the financial and time burden of ART and to reduce logistical barriers, such as simplifying the referral and transfer process, employing patient advocates, and adopting extended and weekend clinic hours.</td>

      <td>Early loss to follow up after enrolment in pre-ART care at a large public clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To estimate loss to follow up (LTFU) between initial enrollment and the first scheduled return medical visit of a pre-antiretroviral therapy (ART) care program for patients not eligible for ART. METHODS: The study was conducted at a public-sector HIV clinic in Johannesburg. We reviewed records of all patients newly enrolled in the pre-ART care program and not yet eligible for ART between January 2007 and February 2008. Crude proportions of patients completing their first return medical visit stratified by patient characteristics were calculated. A modified-Poisson approach was used to estimate directly relative risks of returning for their first return medical visit within 1 year adjusting for patient characteristics as potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 356 patients were identified. Two-thirds had a CD4 count > 350 cells/microl (median [IQR] CD4 = 458 [394, 585]) and were scheduled to return in 6 months for a first medical visit. Seventy-four percent of these patients did not return within one year for this visit. The remaining 36% of all patients had a baseline CD4 count 251-350 cells/microl and were scheduled to return in 3 months. Only 6% of these patients returned within 4 months; 41% returned within one year. Relative risks were positively associated with a patient being employed and negatively associated with the baseline CD4 count. CONCLUSIONS: Given the high rate of LTFU immediately after enrolling in pre-ART care, it is clear that care programs are not expediting the timely initiation of ART. Significantly improved adherence to pre-ART care and monitoring for patients not yet eligible for ART is required for South Africa to achieve its AIDS strategy goals and reduce the problem of late presentation and initiation of ART.</td>

      <td>Patient retention in antiretroviral therapy programs up to three years on treatment in sub-Saharan Africa, 2007-2009: systematic review.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: To estimate the proportion of all-cause adult patient attrition from antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs in service delivery settings in sub-Saharan Africa through 36 months on treatment. METHODS: We identified cohorts within Ovid Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and four conference abstract archives. We summarized retention rates from studies describing observational cohorts from sub-Saharan Africa reporting on adult HIV 1- infected patients initiating first-line three-drug ART. We estimated all-cause attrition rates for 6, 12, 18, 24, or 36 months after ART initiation including patients who died or were lost to follow-up (as defined by the author), but excluding transferred patients. RESULTS: We analysed 33 sources describing 39 cohorts and 226 307 patients. Patients were more likely to be female (median 65%) and had a median age at initiation of 37 (range 34-40). Median starting CD4 count was 109 cells/mm(3). Loss to follow-up was the most common cause of attrition (59%), followed by death (41%). Median attrition at 12, 24 and 36 months was 22.6% (range 7%-45%), 25% (range 11%-32%) and 29.5% (range 13%-36.1%) respectively. After pooling data in a random-effects meta-analysis, retention declined from 86.1% at 6 months to 80.2% at 12 months, 76.8% at 24 months and 72.3% at 36 months. Adjusting for variable follow-up time in a sensitivity analysis, 24 month retention was 70.0% (range: 66.7%-73.3%), while 36 month retention was 64.6% (range: 57.5%-72.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings document the difficulties in retaining patients in care for lifelong treatment, and the progress being made in raising overall retention rates.</td>

      <td>AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma is linked to advanced disease and high mortality in a primary care HIV programme in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma is an important, life-threatening opportunistic infection among people living with HIV/AIDS in resource-limited settings. In western countries, the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and new chemotherapeutic agents has resulted in decreased incidence and improved prognosis of AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. In African cohorts, however, mortality remains high. In this study, we describe disease characteristics and risk factors for mortality in a public sector HIV programme in South Africa. METHODS: We analysed data from an observational cohort study of HIV-infected adults with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma, enrolled between May 2001 and January 2007 in three primary care clinics. Paper records from primary care and tertiary hospital oncology clinics were reviewed to determine the site of Kaposi's sarcoma lesions, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome stage, and treatment. Baseline characteristics, cART use and survival outcomes were extracted from an electronic database maintained for routine monitoring and evaluation. Cox regression was used to model associations with mortality. RESULTS: Of 6292 patients, 215 (3.4%) had AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. Lesions were most commonly oral (65%) and on the lower extremities (56%). One quarter of patients did not receive cART. The mortality and lost-to-follow-up rates were, respectively, 25 (95% CI 19-32) and eight (95% CI 5-13) per 100 person years for patients who received cART, and 70 (95% CI 42-117) and 119 (80-176) per 100 person years for patients who did not receive cART. Advanced T stage (adjusted HR, AHR = 5.3, p < 0.001), advanced S stage (AHR = 5.1, p = 0.008), and absence of chemotherapy (AHR = 2.4, p = 0.012) were associated with mortality. Patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma presented with advanced disease and high rates of mortality and loss to follow up. Risk factors for mortality included advanced Kaposi's sarcoma disease and lack of chemotherapy use. Contributing factors to the high mortality for patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma likely included late diagnosis of HIV disease, late accessibility to cART, and sub-optimal treatment of advanced Kaposi's sarcoma. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the importance of early access to both cART and chemotherapy for patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. Early diagnosis and improved treatment protocols in resource-poor settings are essential.</td>

      <td>Initiating patients on antiretroviral therapy at CD4 cell counts above 200 cells/microl is associated with improved treatment outcomes in South Africa.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: To compare treatment outcomes by starting CD4 cell counts using data from the Comprehensive International Program of Research on AIDS-South Africa trial. DESIGN: An observational cohort study. METHODS: Patients presenting to primary care clinics with CD4 cell counts below 350 cells/microl were randomized to either doctor or nurse-managed HIV care and followed for at least 2 years after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. Clinical and laboratory outcomes were compared by baseline CD4 cell counts. RESULTS: Eight hundred and twelve patients were followed for a median of 27.5 months and 36% initiated ART with a CD4 cell count above 200 cells/microl. Although 10% of patients failed virologically, the risk was nearly double among those with a CD4 cell count of 200 cells/microl or less vs. above 200 cells/microl (12.2 vs. 6.8%). Twenty-one deaths occurred, with a five-fold increased risk for the low CD4 cell count group (3.7 vs. 0.7%). After adjustment, those with a CD4 cell count of 200 cells/microl had twice the risk of death/virologic failure [hazard ratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-3.3] and twice the risk of incident tuberculosis (hazard ratio 1.90; 95% CI, 0.89-4.04) as those above 200 cells/microl. Those with either a CD4 cell count of 200 cells/microl or less (hazard ratio 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.8) or a WHO IV condition (hazard ratio 2.9; 95% CI, 0.93-8.8) alone had a two-to-three-fold increased risk of death/virologic failure vs. those with neither, but those with both conditions had a four-fold increased risk (hazard ratio 3.9; 95% CI, 1.9-8.1). We observed some decreased loss to follow-up among those initiating ART at less than 200 cells/microl (hazard ratio 0.79; 95% CI, 0.50-1.25). CONCLUSION: Patients initiating ART with higher CD4 cell counts had reduced mortality, tuberculosis and less virologic failure than those initiated at lower CD4 cell counts. Our data support increasing CD4 cell count eligibility criteria for ART initiation.</td>

      <td>Early mortality and loss to follow-up in HIV-infected children starting antiretroviral therapy in Southern Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Many HIV-infected children in Southern Africa have been started on antiretroviral therapy (ART), but loss to follow up (LTFU) can be substantial. We analyzed mortality in children retained in care and in all children starting ART, taking LTFU into account. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children who started ART before the age of 16 years in 10 ART programs in South Africa, Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe were included. Risk factors for death in the first year of ART were identified in Weibull models. A meta-analytic approach was used to estimate cumulative mortality at 1 year. RESULTS: Eight thousand two hundred twenty-five children (median age 49 months, median CD4 cell percent 11.6%) were included; 391 (4.8%) died and 523 (7.0%) were LTFU in the first year. Mortality at 1 year was 4.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.8% to 7.4%] in children remaining in care, but 8.7% (5.4% to 12.1%) at the program level, after taking mortality in children and LTFU into account. Factors associated with mortality in children remaining in care included age [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.37; 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.54 comparing > or =120 months with <18 months], CD4 cell percent (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.78 comparing > or =20% with <10%), and clinical stage (HR: 0.12; 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.45 comparing World Health Organization stage I with III/IV). CONCLUSIONS: In children starting ART and remaining in care in Southern Africa mortality at 1 year is <5% but almost twice as high at the program level, when taking LTFU into account. Age, CD4 percentage, and clinical stage are important predictors of mortality at the individual level.</td>

      <td>HIV-1 drug resistance mutations are present in six percent of persons initiating antiretroviral therapy in Lusaka, Zambia.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To assess the mutational patterns and factors associated with baseline drug-resistant HIV-1 present at initiation of first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) at 3 sites in Lusaka, Zambia, in 2007-2008. METHODS: Population sequencing of the HIV-1 pol gene was performed in the PharmAccess African Studies to Evaluate Resistance Monitoring cohort. Drug resistance-associated mutations (DRMs) were identified using the WHO 2009 Surveillance DRM list. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with baseline resistance. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of baseline resistance was 5.7% [31 of 548 participants; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.9 to 7.9]; the prevalence of DRMs associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors was 1.1%, 4.0%, and 1.1%, respectively. Resistance prevalence was 5.2% (27 of 523) in antiretroviral-naive and 16.0% (4 of 25) in antiretroviral-experienced (ie, previous use of ART or antiretroviral prophylaxis for prevention of mother-to-child transmission) participants (P = 0.022). Dual-class resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs was observed in 0.6% of participants. HIV-1 subtype C was identified in 98.0% (537 of 548) of participants. Prior antiretroviral experience (odds ratio: 4.32, CI: 1.34 to 14.0, P = 0.015) and hemoglobin level (highest tertile versus lowest tertile odds ratio: 2.74, CI: 1.09 to 6.89, P = 0.033) were independently associated with baseline resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline resistance may compromise the response to standard NNRTI-based first-line ART in 6% of patients in Lusaka, Zambia. Continuous resistance monitoring is warranted to maintain individual and population-level ART effectiveness.</td>

      <td>Impact of cotrimoxazole on carriage and antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in HIV-infected children in Zambia.</td>
      <td>This is a substudy of a larger randomized controlled trial on HIV-infected Zambian children, which revealed that cotrimoxazole prophylaxis reduced morbidity and mortality despite a background of high cotrimoxazole resistance. The impact of cotrimoxazole on the carriage and antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae as major causes of childhood mortality in HIV-infected children was investigated since these are unclear. Representative nasopharyngeal swabs were taken prior to randomization for 181 of 534 children (92 on cotrimoxazole and 89 on placebo). Bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility were performed by routine methods. Due to reduced mortality, prophylactic cotrimoxazole increased the median time from randomization to the last specimen from 48 to 56 months (P = 0.001). The carriage of H. influenzae was unaltered by cotrimoxazole. Carriage of S. pneumoniae increased slightly in both arms but was not statistically significant in the placebo arm. In S. pneumoniae switching between carriage and no carriage in consecutive pairs of samples was unaffected by cotrimoxazole (P = 0.18) with a suggestion that the probability of remaining carriage free was lower (P = 0.10). In H. influenzae cotrimoxazole decreased switching from carriage to no carriage (P = 0.02). Cotrimoxazole resistance levels were higher in postbaseline samples in the cotrimoxazole arm than in the placebo arm (S. pneumoniae, P < 0.0001; H. influenzae, P = 0.005). Cotrimoxazole decreased switching from cotrimoxazole resistance to cotrimoxazole sensitivity in S. pneumoniae (P = 0.002) and reduced the chance of H. influenzae remaining cotrimoxazole sensitive (P = 0.05). No associations were observed between the percentage of CD4 (CD4%), the change in CD4% from baseline, child age at date of specimen, child gender, or sampling month with carriage of either pathogen.</td>

      <td>The prevalence and drug sensitivity of tuberculosis among patients dying in hospital in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: a postmortem study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death in South Africa by death notification, but accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis is challenging in this setting of high HIV prevalence. We conducted limited autopsies on young adults dying in a single public hospital in the province of KwaZulu-Natal between October 2008 and August 2009 in order to estimate the magnitude of deaths attributable to tuberculosis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We studied a representative sample of 240 adult inpatients (aged 20-45 years) dying after admission to Edendale Hospital. Limited autopsies included collection of respiratory tract secretions and tissue by needle core biopsies of lung, liver, and spleen. Specimens were examined by fluorescent microscopy for acid-fast bacilli and cultured in liquid media; cultures positive for M. tuberculosis were tested for drug susceptibility to first- and second-line antibiotics. Ninety-four percent of our study cohort was HIV seropositive and 50% of decedents had culture-positive tuberculosis at the time of death. Fifty percent of the participants were on treatment for tuberculosis at the time of death and 58% of these treated individuals remained culture positive at the time of death. Of the 50% not receiving tuberculosis treatment, 42% were culture positive. Seventeen percent of all positive cultures were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin (i.e., multidrug resistant); 16% of patients dying during the initiation phase of their first ever course of tuberculosis treatment were infected with multidrug-resistant bacilli. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal the immense toll of tuberculosis among HIV-positive individuals in KwaZulu-Natal. The majority of decedents who remained culture positive despite receiving tuberculosis treatment were infected with pan-susceptible M. tuberculosis, suggesting that the diagnosis of tuberculosis was made too late to alter the fatal course of the infection. There is also a significant burden of undetected multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among HIV-coinfected individuals dying in this setting. New public health approaches that improve early diagnosis of tuberculosis and accelerate the initiation of treatment are urgently needed in this setting.

      <td>Drug resistance is widespread among children who receive long-term antiretroviral treatment at a rural Tanzanian hospital.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: To assess long-term virological efficacy and the emergence of drug resistance in children who receive antiretroviral treatment (ART) in rural Tanzania. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Haydom Lutheran Hospital has provided ART to HIV-infected individuals since 2003. From February through May 2009, a cross-sectional virological efficacy survey was conducted among children (<15 years) who had completed >or=6 months of first-line non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART. Genotypic resistance was determined in those with a viral load of >200 copies/mL. RESULTS: Virological response was measured in 19 of 23 eligible children; 8 of 19 were girls and median age at ART initiation was 5 years (range 2-14 years). Median duration of ART at the time of the survey was 40 months (range 11-61 months). Only 8 children were virologically suppressed (<or=40 copies/mL), whereas 11 children had clinically relevant resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene. The most frequent mutations were M184V (n = 11), conferring resistance to lamivudine and emtricitabine, and Y181C (n = 4), G190A/S (n = 4) and K103N (n = 4), conferring resistance to NNRTIs. Of concern, three children had thymidine analogue mutations, associated with cross-resistance to all nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Despite widespread resistance, however, only one child experienced a new WHO stage 4 event and none had a CD4 cell count of <200 cells/mm(3). CONCLUSIONS: Among children on long-term ART in rural Tanzania, >50% harboured drug resistance. Results for children were markedly poorer than for adults attending the same programme, underscoring the need for improved treatment strategies for children in resource-limited settings.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: The usefulness of plasma human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) DNA as a marker of response to treatment for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated Kaposi sarcoma (AIDS-KS) in an African setting is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a prospective pilot study at the Parirenyatwa Hospital Kaposi Sarcoma Clinic (Harare, Zimbabwe) to investigate the hypothesis that the clinical response of AIDS-KS is associated with suppression of HHV-8 DNA. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) was provided as coformulation of abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine. Clinical response was defined as survival to week 96 with either complete or partial resolution of KS disease. RESULTS: Ninety ART-naive participants (62 men and 28 women) aged >18 years who had human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and biopsy-confirmed KS were studied; 82% had stage T1 disease. Fifty participants received adjunctive chemotherapy. The median CD4(+) lymphocyte count increased from 124 cells/microL at baseline to 281 cells/microL, the plasma HIV-1 RNA level decreased from 4.69 to <2.60 log(10) copies/mL, the plasma HHV-8 DNA level decreased from 660 to <25 copies/mL, and HHV-8 DNA level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells decreased from 2790 to 37 copies/10(6) cells (P < .001 for each comparison). There were 14 deaths (16%) and 13 patients (15%) lost to follow-up. The most common cause of death was infection. Clinical response of KS occurred in 17 participants (19%). Pretreatment plasma HHV-8 DNA levels of <660 copies/mL were associated with greater survival (odds ratio, 2.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-7.53; P = .04) and a better clinical response (odds ratio, 6.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.68-24.19; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: AIDS-KS tumor responses after ART initiation were limited. Pretreatment plasma HHV-8 DNA level may be a surrogate for KS disease that is in need of intensive clinical management.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVES: A prospective cohort study was conducted among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected in-patients with tuberculosis (TB) or other opportunistic infections (OIs) in South Africa to estimate subsequent antiretroviral therapy (ART) uptake and survival. METHODS: Logistic regression modeling explored associations between baseline characteristics and starting ART, and ART exposure-adjusted incidence of death was estimated over 6 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Among 49 participants enrolled, median CD4 cell count at hospital discharge was 42 cells/microl and the most common presenting OIs were TB (76%), Pneumocystis pneumonia (8%), chronic diarrhea (8%), cryptococcal meningitis (6%), and Toxoplasma gondii (4%). By 6 months, only 20 (45%) patients had initiated ART, and four (8%) were lost to follow-up. ART uptake was independently associated with previous use of traditional medicine (OR 7.2, 95%CI 1.4-55.1) and with less advanced HIV infection (baseline CD4 count per 50 cells/microl increase OR 1.4, 95%CI 0.9-2.2). A total of 14 (31%) patients died before initiating ART; the monthly incidence of death did not decrease over the 6-month interval. CONCLUSION: The high mortality observed within the 6 months following hospitalization with TB or other acute OIs indicate that mechanisms are needed to expedite ART for patients after an acquired immune-deficiency syndrome defining illness.</td>

Current World Health Organization guidelines for sexually transmitted infections recommend acyclovir as first-line syndromic treatment of GUD in countries with high herpes simplex virus-2 prevalence (> or =30%). OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent of adoption of acyclovir as syndromic treatment for GUD, and describe procurement, distribution, and cost of acyclovir in the public and private sectors of 8 sub-Saharan African countries. METHODS: We conducted standardized interviews with Ministry of Health (MoH) officials, pharmacists, and other pharmacy workers based in the public and private sectors. Interviews were conducted in Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Price comparisons were conducted using the 2007 median international reference price (IRP) for acyclovir. RESULTS: Of the 8 African countries, 4 surveyed had adopted acyclovir as first-line syndromic GUD treatment in both their essential medical lists and sexually transmitted infection guidelines. Country-specific acquisition prices for acyclovir 200 mg were comparable to the median IRP and ranged from 0.74 to 1.95 times the median IRP. The median retail cost of acyclovir in the private sector ranged from 5.85 to 9.76 times the median IRP. Public health facilities faced cost and regulatory barriers that impeded the requisitioning of acyclovir from the central medical stores. CONCLUSIONS: Systems for drug procurement, distribution, and access in sub-Saharan African countries need strengthening for a GUD treatment policy using acyclovir to be effective.</td>

      <td>Challenges in using mobile phones for collection of antiretroviral therapy adherence data in a resource-limited setting.</td>
      <td>Frequent antiretroviral therapy adherence monitoring could detect incomplete adherence before viral rebound develops and thus potentially prevent treatment failure. Mobile phone technologies make frequent, brief adherence interviews possible in resource-limited settings; however, feasibility and acceptability are unknown. Interactive voice response (IVR) and short message service (SMS) text messaging were used to collect adherence data from 19 caregivers of HIV-infected children in Uganda. IVR calls or SMS quantifying missed doses were sent in the local language once weekly for 3-4 weeks. Qualitative interviews were conducted to assess participant impressions of the technologies. Participant interest and participation rates were high; however, weekly completion rates for adherence queries were low (0-33%), most commonly due to misunderstanding of personal identification numbers. Despite near ubiquity of mobile phone technology in resource-limited settings, individual level collection of healthcare data presents challenges. Further research is needed for effective training and incentive methods.</td>

      <td>Retention of HIV-infected and HIV-exposed children in a comprehensive HIV clinical care programme in Western Kenya.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: To describe incidence rates (IR) and risk factors for loss-to-follow-up (LTFU) among HIV-infected and HIV-exposed children in a large HIV treatment programme in Western Kenya. METHODS: The USAID-AMPATH Partnership has enrolled >100,000 patients (20% children) at 23 clinic sites throughout western Kenya. LTFU is defined as being absent from the clinic for >3 months if on combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) and >6 months if not. Included in this analysis were children aged <14 years, HIV exposed or infected at enrollment, and enrolled between April 2002 and March 2009. The IR for LTFU are presented per 100 child-years (CY) of follow-up. Proportional hazards models with time-independent and time-dependent covariates were used to model factors associated with LTFU. Weight for height Z-scores were calculated using EpiInfo, with severe malnutrition being defined as a Z-score <or=-3.0. Immune suppression was defined as per WHO age-specific categories. RESULTS: There were 13,510 children eligible for analysis, comprising 3106 children who at enrollment were HIV infected and 10,404 children who were HIV exposed. The overall IR of LTFU was 18.4 (17.8-18.9) per 100 CY. Among HIV-infected children, 15.2 (13.8-16.7) and 14.1 (13.1-15.8) per 100 CY became LTFU, pre- and post-cART initiation, respectively. The only independent risk factor for becoming LTFU among the HIV-infected children was severe immune suppression (AHR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.51-3.12). Among the HIV-exposed children, 20.1 per 100 (19.4-20.7) became LTFU. Independent risk factors for LTFU among them were being severely low weight for height (AHR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.25-2.28), being orphaned at enrollment (AHR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.23-1.64), being CDC Class B or C (AHR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.14-1.74), and having received cART (AHR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.23-1.99). Protective against becoming LTFU among the HIV exposed were testing HIV positive (AHR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.21-0.32), older age (AHR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.85-0.96), enrolling in later time periods, and receiving food supplementation (AHR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.32-1.04). CONCLUSIONS: There is a high rate of LTFU among these highly vulnerable children, particularly among the HIV exposed. These data suggest that HIV-infected and HIV-exposed children are at especially high risk for LTFU if they are sick or malnourished.</td>

      <td>Peripartum nevirapine exposure and subsequent clinical outcomes among HIV-infected women receiving antiretroviral therapy for at least 12 months.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: Prior exposure to intrapartum/neonatal nevirapine (NVP) is associated with compromised virologic treatment outcomes once non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) is initiated. We examined the longer-term clinical outcomes in a programmatic setting. METHODS: We compared post-12 month mortality and clinical treatment failure (defined by WHO clinical and immunologic criteria) among women with and without prior NVP exposure in Lusaka, Zambia. RESULTS: Between April 2004 and July 2006, 6740 women initiated an NNRTI-containing regimen. At 12 months, 5172 (78%) remained active and were included in this analysis. Of these, 596 (12%) reported prior NVP exposure, whose time from exposure to ART initiation was: <6 months for 11%, 6-12 months for 13%, >12 months for 37%, unknown for 39%. Overall, women with prior NVP exposure trended towards increased survival (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]: 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27-1.06, P = 0.07) and towards increased hazard of clinical treatment failure (AHR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.95-1.47, P = 0.14), particularly those with exposure for <6 months (AHR: 1.52; 95% CI: 0.94-2.45, P = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Prior NVP exposure appeared to increase risk for clinical treatment failure after 12 months of follow-up, but this finding did not reach statistical significance. With growing evidence linking recent NVP exposure to virologic failure, optimized monitoring algorithms should be considered for women with starting NNRTI-based ART. The association between prior NVP exposure and improved survival has not been previously shown and may be a result of residual confounding around health-seeking behaviours.</td>

      <td>As the global community evaluates the unprecedented investment in the scale-up of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) therapy and considers future investments in HIV care, it is crucial to identify those HIV interventions that maximize the benefit realized from each dollar spent. The use of laboratory monitoring assays--CD4 cell count and HIV RNA level--in decisions about when to initiate and switch antiretroviral therapy may offer substantial clinical benefit, but their economic value remains controversial. Cost-effectiveness analysis can be used to evaluate the value for money of strategies for HIV care, including alternative approaches to laboratory monitoring. Five published cost-effectiveness analyses address the question of CD4 cell count and HIV RNA level monitoring for HIV-infected patients in Africa, with differing conclusions. We describe the use of cost-effectiveness analysis in resource-limited settings and review the cost-effectiveness literature with regard to monitoring the CD4 cell count and HIV RNA level in Africa, highlighting some of the most critical issues in this debate.</td>

      <td>Incident tuberculosis during antiretroviral therapy contributes to suboptimal immune reconstitution in a large urban HIV clinic in sub-Saharan Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) effectively decreases tuberculosis (TB) incidence long-term, but is associated with high TB incidence rates in the first 6 months. We sought to determine the incidence and the long-term effects of TB during ART on HIV treatment outcome, and the risk factors for incident TB during ART in a large urban HIV clinic in Uganda. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Routinely collected longitudinal clinical data from all patients initiated on first-line ART was retrospectively analysed. 5,982 patients were included with a median baseline CD4+ T cell count (CD4 count) of 117 cells/mm(3) (interquartile range [IQR]; 42, 182). In the first 2 years, there were 336 (5.6%) incident TB events in 10,710 person-years (py) of follow-up (3.14 cases/100 pyar [95% CI 2.82-3.49]); incidence rates at 0-3, 3-6, 6-12 and 12-24 months were 11.25 (9.58-13.21), 6.27 (4.99-7.87), 2.47 (1.87-3.36) and 1.02 (0.80-1.31), respectively. Incident TB during ART was independently associated with baseline CD4 count of <50 cells/mm(3) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.84 [1.25-2.70], P = 0.002) and male gender (HR 1.68 [1.34-2.11], P<0.001). After two years on ART, the patients who had developed TB in the first 12 months had a significantly lower median CD4 count increase (184 cells/mm(3) [IQR; 107, 258, n = 118] vs 209 cells/mm(3) [124, 309, n = 2166], P = 0.01), a larger proportion of suboptimal immune reconstitution according to two definitions (increase in CD4 count <200 cells/mm(3): 57.4% vs 46.9%, P = 0.03, and absolute CD4 count <200 cells/mm(3): 30.4 vs 19.9%, P = 0.006), and a higher percentage of immunological failure according to the WHO criteria (13.6% vs 6.5%, P = 0.003). Incident TB during ART was independently associated with poor CD4 count recovery and fulfilling WHO immunological failure definitions. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Incident TB during ART occurs most often within 3 months and in patients with CD4 counts less than 50 cells/mm(3). Incident TB during ART is associated with long-term impairment in immune recovery.</td>

      <td>Favourable one-year ART outcomes in adult Malawians with hepatitis B and C co-infection.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated the impact of chronic hepatitis B and C infection on antiretroviral therapy (ART) outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa. Hepatotoxicity may be a particular concern in co-infected patients taking nevirapine-stavudine-lamivudine. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 300 Malawian adults starting ART and describe one-year ART outcomes according to viral hepatitis status. RESULTS: At baseline, patients had advanced HIV disease (29.3% were in WHO stage 4; mean CD4 = 157 cells/microL; mean log(10)HIV-1 RNA = 5.24 copies/ml). Co-infection with hepatitis B, C and B + C were present in 6.7%, 5.7% and 1.7% respectively. At 50 weeks, all-cause mortality was 43 (14.3%). Sixteen (5.3%) had transferred to another unit. Eight (2.7%) were lost to follow up. Sixteen (5.3%) had stopped ART. 217 (72.3%) were alive on ART, of whom 82.5% had an HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/ml at week 50. During the first 50 weeks of ART, severe hepatotoxicity (liver enzyme values >5 times upper level of normal) occurred in 9%, but did not result in any ART discontinuations. Clinical hepatitis or jaundice was not observed. There were no significant differences in occurrence of hepatotoxicity, other side effects, mortality, severe morbidity, immune reconstitution or virological failure between hepatitis B and/or C co-infected patients and those who were not. Viral hepatitis co-infection was not associated with severe hepatotoxicity, mortality, severe morbidity or virological failure in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that screening for viral hepatitis B and C and liver enzyme monitoring may not require high priority in ART programmes in sub-Saharan Africa.</td>

      <td>Excluding pregnancy among women initiating antiretroviral therapy: efficacy of a family planning job aid.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Guidelines for initiating ART recommend pregnancy testing, typically a urine test, as part of the basic laboratory package. The principal reason for this recommendation is that Efavirenz, a first-line antiretroviral medication, has the potential of causing birth defects when used in the first trimester of pregnancy and is therefore contraindicated for use by pregnant women. Unfortunately, in many African countries pregnancy tests are not routinely provided or available in ART clinics, and, when available outside clinics, are often not affordable for clients.Recently, the World Health Organization added a family planning job aid called the 'pregnancy checklist,' developed by researchers at Family Health International, as a recommended tool for screening new ART clients to exclude pregnancy. Although the checklist has been validated for excluding pregnancy among family planning clients, there are no data on its efficacy among ART clients.This study was conducted to assess the clinical performance of a job aid to exclude pregnancy among HIV positive women initiating ART. METHODS: Non-menstruating women eligible for ART were enrolled from 20 sites in four provinces in Zambia. The pregnancy checklist was administered followed by a urine pregnancy test as a reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were estimated. RESULTS: Of the 200 women for whom the checklist ruled out pregnancy, 198 were not pregnant, for an estimated negative predictive value of 99%. The sensitivity of the checklist was 90.0%, and specificity was 38.7%. Among the women, 416 out of 534 (77.9%) did not abstain from sex since their last menses. Only 72 out of the 534 women (13.4%) reported using reliable contraception. Among the 416 women who did not abstain, 376 (90.4%) did not use reliable contraception. CONCLUSION: The pregnancy checklist is effective for excluding pregnancy in many women initiating ART, but its moderate sensitivity and specificity precludes its use to completely replace pregnancy testing. Its use should be encouraged in low resource settings where pregnancy tests are unavailable or must be rationed. Family planning methods should be available and integrated into ART clinics.</td>

In our HIV cohort in rural Tanzania with 12% prevalence of PPE, we have retrospectively analyzed responses to available treatments. Oral promethazine improved itching (P < 0.0058) and clinical scores (P < 0.032) significantly more than topical steroids. Disease activity did not correlate with CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts and was independent of anti-retroviral medication. Therefore, oral antihistamines are an effective first-line treatment for PPE.</td>

      <td>The use of ritonavir as a protease inhibitor boost is rare in sub-Saharan Africa because a heat-stable formula is not available. We report the results of an open-label pilot trial with unboosted atazanavir in combination with lamivudine and didanosine as first-line therapy conducted in Senegal. Treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adult patients without active opportunistic disease were included. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/ml at week 48. Forty patients (12 men and 28 women; mean age +/- SD: 40 +/- 9 years) were included. Treatment was changed during the study for two patients (pregnancy, tuberculosis); one patient was lost to follow-up and one patient died (gastroenteritis with cachexia). At week 48, 78% [95% confidence interval (CI): 65-90%] and 68% (95% CI: 53-82%) of the patients had HIV-1 RNA <400 and <50 copies/ml, respectively (intent-to-treat analysis; not completer = failure). Among the seven patients with HIV-1 RNA >or=400 copies/ml at week 48, five were not compliant; genotyping analysis (n = 4) did not reveal a major mutation for protease inhibitors. The mean CD4 cell count change from baseline to week 48 was +238 +/- 79 cells/mm(3). The combination of unboosted atazanavir with lamivudine and didanosine was efficient and well tolerated in HIV-1-infected patients with results similar to those observed in Northern countries. These results suggest that unboosted atazanavir with its high genetic barrier could be a valuable alternative to NNRTIs in resource-limited countries in some HIV-1-infected patients in case of compliance issues with NNRTIs, intolerance to NNRTIs, resistance mutations to NNRTIs, in women with childbearing potential, or as a maintenance therapy in patients with virological suppression.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: We assessed risk factors for viremia and drug resistance among long-term recipients of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa. METHODS: In 2008, we conducted a cross-sectional study among patients receiving ART for 12 months or more. Genotypic resistance testing was performed on individuals with a viral load higher than 400 RNA copies/ml. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess associations. RESULTS: Of 998 participants, 75% were women with a median age of 41 years. Most (64%) had been on treatment for more than 3 years. The prevalence of viremia was 14% (n = 139): 12% (102/883) on first-line [i.e. nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen] and 33% (37/115) on second-line (i.e. protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen) ART. Of viremic patients, 78% had drug resistance mutations. For NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs, the prevalence of mutations was 64, 81 and 2%, respectively, among first-line failures and 29, 54 and 6%, respectively, among second-line failures. M184V/I, K103N and V106A/M were the most common mutations. Significant risk factors associated with viremia on first-line regimen included concurrent tuberculosis treatment [odds ratio (OR) 6.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-18.8, P < 0.01] and a recent history of poor adherence (OR 2.7, 1.3-5.6, P = 0.01). Among second-line failures, attending a public clinic (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.8-11.3, P < 0.01) and not having a refrigerator at home (OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.2-37.5, P = 0.03) were risk factors for virological failure. CONCLUSION: Risk factors for viral failure were line regimen dependent. Second-line ART recipients had a higher rate of viremia, albeit with infrequent PI drug resistance mutations. Measures to maintain effective virologic suppression should include increased adherence counseling, attention to concomitant tuberculosis treatment and heat-stable formulations of second-line ART regimens.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVES: To determine the safety of 0.5% and 2% PRO 2000 gel in terms of local and systemic adverse events (AE) and the acceptability of gel use. DESIGN: A randomised placebo-controlled trial among healthy, sexually active African women aged 18-45 years. Between June 2003 and September 2004, 180 consenting women were randomly assigned to one of four groups: PRO 2000 gel (0.5% or 2%), placebo gel, or condom use only. Participants were screened for sexually transmitted infections, with HIV counselling and testing. Women randomly assigned to gel used this intravaginally twice a day for 28 days. Follow-up visits were fortnightly up to 6 weeks from enrolment, and comprised a physical examination including colposcopy, laboratory testing and questionnaire interviews. RESULTS: Ten women were lost to follow-up, none due to AE. Adherence with total gel doses was 69%. Observed rates of the primary toxicity endpoints, ulceration greater than 2 x 1 cm and clinically relevant coagulation abnormalities were, for PRO 2000 0.5%: 1.6% (95% CI 0.04% to 8.5%) and 0% (97.5% CI 0% to 5.7%), and for PRO 2000 2%: 0% and 0% (97.5% CI 0% to 5.9%). Women randomly assigned to active gels did not show an increased rate of AE. Gel use had no significant effect on haematology and biochemistry results. Women found gel use highly acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: Both concentrations of PRO 2000 gel were found to be safe and well tolerated. These data justified testing the gels in large-scale effectiveness trials.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: Short cycle treatment interruption could reduce toxicity and drug costs and contribute to further expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs. METHODS: A 72 week, non-inferiority trial enrolled one hundred forty six HIV positive persons receiving ART (CD4+ cell count > or =125 cells/mm(3) and HIV RNA plasma levels <50 copies/ml) in one of three arms: continuous, 7 days on/7 days off and 5 days on/2 days off treatment. Primary endpoint was ART treatment failure determined by plasma HIV RNA level, CD4+ cell count decrease, death attributed to study participation, or opportunistic infection. RESULTS: Following enrollment of 32 participants, the 7 days on/7 days off arm was closed because of a failure rate of 31%. Six of 52 (11.5%) participants in the 5 days on/2 days off arm failed. Five had virologic failure and one participant had immunologic failure. Eleven of 51 (21.6%) participants in the continuous treatment arm failed. Nine had virologic failure with 1 death (lactic acidosis) and 1 clinical failure (extra-pulmonary TB). The upper 97.5% confidence boundary for the difference between the percent of non-failures in the 5 days on/2 days off arm (88.5% non-failure) compared to continuous treatment (78.4% non failure) was 4.8% which is well within the preset non-inferiority margin of 15%. No significant difference was found in time to failure in the 2 study arms (p = 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: Short cycle 5 days on/2 days off intermittent ART was at least as effective as continuous therapy.

OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of women undergoing cervical cancer screening after HIV diagnosis at primary health clinics, demographic characteristics of women referred for colposcopy at a tertiary centre, and outcomes of therapy for precancerous lesions of the cervix. RESULTS: The proportion of women undergoing at least one Pap smear at HIV primary health clinics after HIV diagnosis was low (13.1%). Women referred for colposcopy tended to be HIV-positive and over the age of 30 years, and in most (70.2%) cytological examination revealed high-grade cervical dysplasia. HIV-positive women treated with excision for precancerous lesions of the cervix were significantly more likely than their HIV-negative counterparts to undergo incomplete excision, experience persistent cervical disease after treatment, and be lost to follow-up. CONCLUSION: Cervical cancer screening efforts must be scaled up for women with HIV. Treatment and surveillance guidelines for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in HIV-positive women may need to be revised and new interventions developed to reduce incomplete treatment and patient default.</td>

      <td>Outcomes after virologic failure of first-line ART in South Africa.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To determine initial 24-week outcomes among prospectively enrolled patients with failure of initial antiretroviral therapy (ART). METHODS: Baseline virologic failure was defined as HIV-1 viral load greater than 1000 copies/ml. Second-line ART was informed by results of genotype testing and selected from agents in the South-African public sector. Twenty-four week endpoints included virologic suppression and mortality. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 141 patients (median CD4 cell count and viral load at failure of 173 cells/microl and 17 500 copies/ml). The median prior duration of initial ART was 12.0 months. At least one major resistance mutation was found in 87% of patients. After 24 weeks of follow-up, intent-to-treat virologic suppression (<50 copies/ml) was 65%, as-treated virologic suppression was 78%, the median CD4 cell count improvement was 88 cells/microl and the mortality was 6%. The median CD4 cell count at initial virologic failure among those who died was 70 cells/microl, compared to 182 cells/microl among patients who survived (P = 0.01). Patients with wild-type virus at initial failure (N = 19) had inferior outcomes after switch. The presence of nucleoside analogue resistance mutations at failure did not affect early efficacy of boosted-protease inhibitor regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Virologic monitoring linked to resistance testing helped demonstrate the efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir-containing second-line regimens in South Africa. A switch to second-line regimens in patients with virologic failure and drug resistance has substantial and rapid immunological and clinical benefits. Resistance testing identified a high-risk group without resistance who might benefit from increased medication access and/or adherence support.</td>

      <td>Associations with virologic treatment failure in adults on antiretroviral therapy in South Africa.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been available in government facilities in the Western Cape Province of South Africa since 2001. We aimed to investigate factors associated with virologic treatment failure in this setting. DESIGN: Case-control study, matched on facility and on starting date and duration of HAART. METHODS: Cases and controls were identified from clinic registers from May 2001 to June 2006. Cases were patients who switched to second-line therapy after confirmed virologic failure (2 consecutive viral loads above 1000 copies/mL). Controls were on first-line treatment with viral load <400 copies per milliliter at the time of case incidence. RESULTS: One hundred thirty cases and 238 controls were selected from 8 clinics (median 16.6 months on HAART, interquartile range: 12.2-24.6). Treatment interruptions [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 8.6, 95% confidence interval: 3.6 to 20.8], prior nevirapine-based prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) treatment (AOR: 9.6, 95% confidence interval: 2.9 to 32.2), a baseline CD4 count less than 50 cells per microliter or from 50-150 cells per microliter (AOR: 6.6, 95% confidence interval: 2.3 to 18.8 and AOR: 5.8, 95% confidence interval: 2.1 to 16.3 compared with a baseline CD4 count of more than 150 cells/microL), and the use of nevirapine in the initial regimen (AOR: 2.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.4 to 4.7) were all independently associated with virologic treatment failure. CONCLUSIONS: In this setting, nevirapine in the initial HAART regimen or for PMTCT treatment is associated with virologic treatment failure, together with low CD4 count at ART initiation. Earlier initiation of HAART and access to improved triple therapy and PMTCT regimens are priorities for HIV programs in Southern Africa.</td>

      <td>In the absence of marriage: long-term concurrent partnerships, pregnancy, and HIV risk dynamics among South African young adults.</td>
      <td>In KwaZulu/Natal, South Africa, where HIV prevalence is among the world's highest, a longitudinal qualitative study of partnership dynamics and HIV preventive behaviors was conducted. 47 young adults aged 18-24 participated in in-depth interviews, and 29 were re-interviewed 2 years later. Five analytical domains emerged: primary partnerships, love and romance; secondary partnerships; pregnancy/parenthood; condom use/prevention; and contextual influences, including schooling and future aspirations. Primary relationships were long-lasting, with most men and women in the same relationship at 2-year follow-up. Secondary, casual partnerships were common for men and women, although these were shorter and changed frequently. Love and marriage aspirations were not viewed as incompatible with secondary partners. Condom use increased over time in some primary relationships, but decreased in others, and was nearly universal with non-primary partners. Pregnancy, school drop-out, and economic need strongly influence young people's lifecourse. These findings suggest the need to focus prevention efforts on the partnership context, including partner reduction, and structural factors that impede or enhance prevention success.</td>

      <td>Second-line treatment in the Malawi antiretroviral programme: high early mortality, but good outcomes in survivors, despite extensive drug resistance at baseline.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: The Malawi antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme uses the public health approach to identify ART failure. Advanced disease progression may occur before switching to second-line ART. We report outcomes for patients evaluated and initiated on second-line treatment in Malawi. METHODS: Patients meeting Malawi immunological or clinical criteria for ART failure in two large urban ART clinics were evaluated for virological failure (viral load >400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) and, if failure was confirmed, initiated on second-line ART (zidovudine/lamivudine/tenofovir/lopinavir/ritonavir). Patients were seen monthly and laboratory evaluations were performed quarterly and as needed. We performed logistic regression modelling to identify factors associated with mortality, mortality or new HIV illnesses, and virological suppression at 12 months. RESULTS: Of the 109 patients with confirmed virological failure, five patients died prior to initiation, three declined switching and 101 patients initiated second-line treatment. Over 12 months, 10 additional patients died, 34 patients experienced 45 HIV-related events, and 19 patients experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicities. Among survivors, 85.2% had HIV-1 RNA<400 copies/mL at 12 months. While power to distinguish differences was limited, response rates were similar regardless of baseline resistance level. The median CD4 count increase was 142 cells/microL. World Health Organization clinical failure at baseline [odds ratio (OR) 3.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-10.59] and body mass index <18.5 (OR 4.43; 95% CI 1.15-17.12) were risk factors for death. Baseline CD4 count <50 cells/microL was associated with increased risk for death or morbidity at 12 months (OR 2.57; 95% CI 1.01-6.52). CONCLUSIONS: Second-line treatment in Malawi was associated with substantial mortality, morbidity and toxicity but, among survivors, virological outcomes were favourable.</td>

      <td>The failure of routine rapid HIV testing: a case study of improving low sensitivity in the field.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The rapid HIV antibody test is the diagnostic tool of choice in low and middle-income countries. Previous evidence suggests that rapid HIV diagnostic tests may underperform in the field, failing to detect a substantial number of infections. A research study inadvertently discovered that a clinic rapid HIV testing process was failing to detect cases of established (high antibody titer) infection, exhibiting an estimated 68.7% sensitivity (95% CI [41.3%-89.0%]) over the course of the first three weeks of observation. The setting is a public service clinic that provides STI diagnosis and treatment in an impoverished, peri-urban community outside of Cape Town, South Africa. METHODS: The researchers and local health administrators collaborated to investigate the cause of the poor test performance and make necessary corrections. The clinic changed the brand of rapid test being used and later introduced quality improvement measures. Observations were made of the clinic staff as they administered rapid HIV tests to real patients. Estimated testing sensitivity was calculated as the number of rapid HIV test positive individuals detected by the clinic divided by this number plus the number of PCR positive, highly reactive 3rd generation ELISA patients identified among those who were rapid test negative at the clinic. RESULTS: In the period of five months after the clinic made the switch of rapid HIV tests, estimated sensitivity improved to 93.5% (95% CI [86.5%-97.6%]), during which time observations of counselors administering tests at the clinic found poor adherence to the recommended testing protocol. Quality improvement measures were implemented and estimated sensitivity rose to 95.1% (95% CI [83.5%-99.4%]) during the final two months of full observation. CONCLUSIONS: Poor testing procedure in the field can lead to exceedingly low levels of rapid HIV test sensitivity, making it imperative that stringent quality control measures are implemented where they do not already exist. Certain brands of rapid-testing kits may perform better than others when faced with sub-optimal use.</td>

      <td>A cluster randomized trial of routine HIV-1 viral load monitoring in Zambia: study design, implementation, and baseline cohort characteristics.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The benefit of routine HIV-1 viral load (VL) monitoring of patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-constrained settings is uncertain because of the high costs associated with the test and the limited treatment options. We designed a cluster randomized controlled trial to compare the use of routine VL testing at ART-initiation and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months, versus our local standard of care (which uses immunological and clinical criteria to diagnose treatment failure, with discretionary VL testing when the two do not agree). METHODOLOGY: Dedicated study personnel were integrated into public-sector ART clinics. We collected participant information in a dedicated research database. Twelve ART clinics in Lusaka, Zambia constituted the units of randomization. Study clinics were stratified into pairs according to matching criteria (historical mortality rate, size, and duration of operation) to limit the effect of clustering, and independently randomized to the intervention and control arms. The study was powered to detect a 36% reduction in mortality at 18 months. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From December 2006 to May 2008, we completed enrollment of 1973 participants. Measured baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the study arms. Enrollment was staggered by clinic pair and truncated at two matched sites. CONCLUSIONS: A large clinical trial of routing VL monitoring was successfully implemented in a dynamic and rapidly growing national ART program. Close collaboration with local health authorities and adequate reserve staff were critical to success. Randomized controlled trials such as this will likely prove valuable in determining long-term outcomes in resource-constrained settings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00929604.</td>

      <td>Couples' voluntary counselling and testing and nevirapine use in antenatal clinics in two African capitals: a prospective cohort study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: With the accessibility of prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) services in sub-Saharan Africa, more women are being tested for HIV in antenatal care settings. Involving partners in the counselling and testing process could help prevent horizontal and vertical transmission of HIV. This study was conducted to assess the feasibility of couples' voluntary counseling and testing (CVCT) in antenatal care and to measure compliance with PMTCT. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted over eight months at two public antenatal clinics in Kigali, Rwanda, and Lusaka, Zambia. A convenience sample of 3625 pregnant women was enrolled. Of these, 1054 women were lost to follow up. The intervention consisted of same-day individual voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) and weekend CVCT; HIV-positive participants received nevirapine tablets. In Kigali, nevirapine syrup was provided in the labour and delivery ward; in Lusaka, nevirapine syrup was supplied in pre-measured single-dose syringes. The main outcome measures were nurse midwife-recorded deliveries and reported nevirapine use. RESULTS: In eight months, 1940 women enrolled in Kigali (984 VCT, 956 CVCT) and 1685 women enrolled in Lusaka (1022 VCT, 663 CVCT). HIV prevalence was 14% in Kigali, and 27% in Lusaka. Loss to follow up was more common in Kigali than Lusaka (33% vs. 24%, p = 0.000). In Lusaka, HIV-positive and HIV-negative women had significantly different loss-to-follow-up rates (30% vs. 22%, p = 0.002). CVCT was associated with reduced loss to follow up: in Kigali, 31% of couples versus 36% of women testing alone (p = 0.011); and in Lusaka, 22% of couples versus 25% of women testing alone (p = 0.137). Among HIV-positive women with follow up, CVCT had no impact on nevirapine use (86-89% in Kigali; 78-79% in Lusaka). CONCLUSIONS: Weekend CVCT, though new, was feasible in both capital cities. The beneficial impact of CVCT on loss to follow up was significant, while nevirapine compliance was similar in women tested alone or with their partners. Pre-measured nevirapine syrup syringes provided flexibility to HIV-positive mothers in Lusaka, but may have contributed to study loss to follow up. These two prevention interventions remain a challenge, with CVCT still operating without supportive government policy in Zambia.</td>

      <td>Challenges in implementing HIV load testing in South Africa.</td>
      <td>The South African antiretroviral treatment guidelines recommend the use of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) load testing for patient monitoring and, in particular, to assist in switching to second-line treatment regimens. There are significant challenges to implementing HIV load testing on the scale that is required in South Africa. To put this in context, approximately 560,000 HIV-infected individuals are receiving antiretroviral therapy, and program recommendations include viral load testing twice per year. Currently, a 3-tiered laboratory infrastructure exists with tertiary facilities and, to some extent, secondary laboratories able to implement quantitative HIV nucleic acid testing. Challenges include high sample volumes, transportation logistics from remote sites, costs, phlebotomy in children, a national skills shortage, and sample throughput of technology platforms. Several approaches are thus being explored simultaneously: (1) the feasibility of establishing higher throughput and more automated central laboratories; (2) improvement of current sample collection, transportation, and storage techniques; (3) alternative viral load technologies, including flow-based marker screening approaches to reduce testing volumes, and (4) point-of-care viral load testing strategies for clinics. The development of appropriate solutions for each laboratory tier in South Africa will require close collaboration between researchers in the field and partners in industry.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVES: To compare rates of mother to child transmission of HIV and infant survival in women-infant dyads receiving different interventions in a prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (pMTCT) program in western Kenya. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using prospectively collected data stored in an electronic medical record system. SETTING: Eighteen HIV clinics in western Kenya. POPULATION: HIV-exposed infants enrolled between February 2002 and July 2007, at any of the United States Agency for International Development-Academic Model Providing Access To Healthcare partnership clinics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Combined endpoint (CE) of infant HIV status and mortality at 3 and 18 months. ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics, chi Fisher exact test, and multivariable modeling. RESULTS: Between February 2002 and July 2007, 2477 HIV-exposed children were registered for care by the United States Agency for International Development-Academic Model Providing Access To Healthcare partnership pMTCT program before 3 months of age. Median age at enrollment was 6.1 weeks; 50.4% infants were male. By 3 months, 31 of 2477 infants (1.3%) were dead and 183 (7.4%) were lost to follow-up. One thousand (40%) underwent HIV DNA Polymerase Chain Reaction virologic test at a median age of 8.3 weeks: 5% were HIV infected, 89% uninfected, and 6% were indeterminate. Of the 968 infants with specific test results or mortality data at 3 months, the CE of HIV infection or death was reached in 84 of 968 (8.7%) infants. The 3-month CE was significantly impacted (A) by maternal prophylaxis [51 of 752 (6.8%) combination antiretroviral therapy (cART); 8 of 69 (11.6%) single-dose nevirapine (sdNVP); and 25 of 147 (17%) no prophylaxis (P < 0.001)] and (B) by feeding method for the 889 of 968 (91.8%) mother-infant pairs for which feeding choice was documented [5 of 29 (17.2%) exclusive breastfeeding; 13 of 110 (11.8%) mixed feeding; and 54 of 750 (7.2%) formula feeding (P = 0.041)]. Of the 1201 infants > or = 18 months of age: 41 (3.4%) were deceased and 329 (27.4%) were lost to follow-up. Of 621 of 831 (74.7%) infants tested, 65 (10.5%) were infected resulting in a CE of 103 of 659 (15.6%). CE differed significantly by maternal prophylaxis [52 of 441 (11.8%) for cART; 13 of 96 (13.5%) for sdNVP; and 38 of 122 (31.2%) no therapy group (P < 0.001)] but not by feeding method for the 638 of 659 (96.8%) children with documented feeding choice [7 of 35 (20%) exclusive breastfeeding, 14 of 63 (22.2%) mixed, and 74 of 540 (13.7%) formula (P = 0.131)]. On multivariate analysis, sdNVP (odds ratio: 0.4; 95% confidence interval: 0.2 to 0.8) and cART (odds ratio: 0.3; 95% confidence interval: 0.2 to 0.6) were associated with fewer CE. At 18 months, feeding method was not significantly associated with the CE. CONCLUSIONS: Though ascertainment bias is likely, results strongly suggest a benefit of antiretroviral prophylaxis in reducing infant death and HIV infection, but do not show a benefit at 18-months from the use of formula. There was a high rate of loss to follow up, and adherence to the HIV infant testing protocol was less than 50% indicating the need to address barriers related to infant HIV testing, and to improve outreach and follow-up services.</td>

      <td>An empirical approach to defining loss to follow-up among patients enrolled in antiretroviral treatment programs.</td>
      <td>In many programs providing antiretroviral therapy (ART), clinicians report substantial patient attrition; however, there are no consensus criteria for defining patient loss to follow-up (LTFU). Data on a multisite human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment cohort in Lusaka, Zambia, were used to determine an empirical "days-late" definition of LTFU among patients on ART. Cohort members were classified as either "in care" or LTFU as of December 31, 2007, according to a range of days-late intervals. The authors then looked forward in the database to determine which patients actually returned to care at any point over the following year. The interval that best minimized LTFU misclassification was described as "best-performing." Overall, 33,704 HIV-infected adults on ART were included. Nearly one-third (n = 10,196) were at least 1 day late for an appointment. The best-performing LTFU definition was 56 days after a missed visit, which had a sensitivity of 84.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 83.2, 85.0), specificity of 97.5% (95% CI: 97.3, 97.7), and misclassification of 5.1% (95% CI: 4.8, 5.3). The 60-day threshold performed similarly well, with only a marginal difference (<0.1%) in misclassification. This analysis suggests that > or =60 days since the last appointment is a reasonable definition of LTFU. Standardization to empirically derived definitions of LTFU will permit more reliable comparisons within and across programs.</td>

      <td>Predicting virologic failure among HIV-1-infected children receiving antiretroviral therapy in Tanzania: a cross-sectional study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Many HIV care and treatment programs in resource-limited settings rely on clinical and immunologic monitoring of antiretroviral therapy (ART), but accuracy of this strategy to detect virologic failure (VF) among children has not been evaluated. METHODS: A cross-sectional sample of HIV-infected children aged 1-16 years on ART >or=6 months receiving care at a Tanzanian referral center underwent clinical staging, CD4 lymphocyte measurement, plasma HIV-1 RNA level, and complete blood count. Associations with VF (HIV-1 RNA >or=400 copies/mL) were determined utilizing bivariable and multivariate analyses; accuracy of current clinical and immunologic guidelines in identifying children with VF was assessed. FINDINGS: Of 206 children (median age 8.7 years, ART duration 2.4 years), 65 (31.6%) demonstrated VF at enrollment. Clinical and immunological criteria identified 2 (3.5%) of 57 children with VF on first-line therapy, exhibiting 3.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity. VF was associated with younger age, receipt of nevirapine vs. efavirenz-based regimen, CD4% < 25%, and physician documentation of maladherence (P < 0.05 on bivariable analysis); the latter 2 factors remained significant on multivariate logistic regression. INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates poor performance of clinical and immunologic criteria in identifying children with virologic failure. Affordable techniques for measuring HIV-1 RNA level applicable in resource-limited settings are urgently needed.</td>

METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all patients with KS treated with single agent gemcitabine following failure of first-line Adriamycin, bleomycin, and vincristine (ABV). Baseline demographics were collected, and clinicians' assessments of response were utilized to fill out objective criteria for both response as well as symptom benefit assessment. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with KS who had previously failed first-line therapy with ABV were evaluated. Following treatment, 22 of the 23 patients responded positively to treatment with stable disease or better. Of the 18 patients who had completed therapy, with a median follow-up of 5 months, 12 patients had no documented progression. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment options in the resource-constrained setting are limited, both by financial constraints as well as the need to avoid myelotoxicity, which is associated with high morbidity in this treatment setting. This work shows that gemcitabine has promising activity in KS, with both objective responses and clinical benefit observed in this care setting. Gemcitabine as a single agent merits further investigation for AIDS-associated KS.</td>

      <td>The "ART" of linkage: pre-treatment loss to care after HIV diagnosis at two PEPFAR sites in Durban, South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Although loss to follow-up after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation is increasingly recognized, little is known about pre-treatment losses to care (PTLC) after an initial positive HIV test. Our objective was to determine PTLC in newly identified HIV-infected individuals in South Africa. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We assembled the South African Test, Identify and Link (STIAL) Cohort of persons presenting for HIV testing at two sites offering HIV and CD4 count testing and HIV care in Durban, South Africa. We defined PTLC as failure to have a CD4 count within 8 weeks of HIV diagnosis. We performed multivariate analysis to identify factors associated with PTLC. From November 2006 to May 2007, of 712 persons who underwent HIV testing and received their test result, 454 (64%) were HIV-positive. Of those, 206 (45%) had PTLC. Infected patients were significantly more likely to have PTLC if they lived > or = 10 kilometers from the testing center (RR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.11-1.71), had a history of tuberculosis treatment (RR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.00-1.58), or were referred for testing by a health care provider rather than self-referred (RR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.22-2.13). Patients with one, two or three of these risks for PTLC were 1.88, 2.50 and 3.84 times more likely to have PTLC compared to those with no risk factors. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Nearly half of HIV-infected persons at two high prevalence sites in Durban, South Africa, failed to have CD4 counts following HIV diagnosis. These high rates of pre-treatment loss to care highlight the urgent need to improve rates of linkage to HIV care after an initial positive HIV test.</td>

      <td>High treatment failure and default rates for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, 2000-2003.</td>
      <td>SETTING: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has emerged as a significant public health threat in South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To describe treatment outcomes and determine risk factors associated with unfavorable outcomes among MDR-TB patients admitted to the provincial TB referral hospital in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study of MDR-TB patients admitted from 2000 to 2003. RESULTS: Of 1209 MDR-TB patients with documented treatment outcomes, 491 (41%) were cured, 35 (3%) completed treatment, 208 (17%) failed treatment, 223 (18%) died and 252 (21%) defaulted. Of the total number of patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, 52% were HIV-infected. Treatment failure, death and default each differed in their risk factors. Greater baseline resistance (aOR 2.3-3.0), prior TB (aOR 1.7), and diagnosis in 2001, 2002 or 2003 (aOR 1.9-2.3) were independent risk factors for treatment failure. HIV co-infection was a risk factor for death (aOR 5.6), and both HIV (aOR 2.0) and male sex (aOR 1.9) were risk factors for treatment default. CONCLUSION: MDR-TB treatment outcomes in KwaZulu-Natal were substantially worse than those published from other MDR-TB cohorts. Interventions such as concurrent antiretroviral therapy and decentralized MDR-TB treatment should be considered to improve MDR-TB outcomes in this high HIV prevalence setting.</td>

      <td>Virological follow-up of adult patients in antiretroviral treatment programmes in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review.</td>
      <td>Following large-scale roll-out of antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa, the non-clinical efficacy of antiretroviral therapy has received little attention. We aimed to systematically review virological efficacy and drug-resistance outcomes of programmes of antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa. 89 studies with heterogeneous design, definitions, and methods were identified. Overall, in on-treatment analysis, 10 351 (78%) of 13 288 patients showed virological suppression after 6 months of antiretroviral therapy, 7413 (76%) of 9794 after 12 months, and 3840 (67%) of 5690 after 24 months. Long-term virological data are scarce. Genotyping results were available for patients with virological failure (HIV-1 RNA greater than 1000 copies per mL). Most patients (839 of 849; 99%) were infected with a non-B HIV-1 subtype. However, drug-resistance patterns were largely similar to those in subtype B. Resistance profiles were associated with the antiretroviral drugs commonly used: the lamivudine-associated M184V mutation was most common, followed by K103N which is associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Thymidine-analogue mutations and the K65R mutation were less common. First-line antiretroviral therapy regimens used in sub-Saharan Africa are effective. Profiles of drug resistance suggest that a second-line treatment regimen based on protease inhibitors, with a backbone of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, is a reasonable option for patients with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa who experience first-line treatment failure.</td>

      <td>Integration of HIV/AIDS services into African primary health care: lessons learned for health system strengthening in Mozambique - a case study.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: In 2004, Mozambique, supported by large increases in international disease-specific funding, initiated a national rapid scale-up of antiretroviral treatment (ART) and HIV care through a vertical "Day Hospital" approach. Though this model showed substantial increases in people receiving treatment, it diverted scarce resources away from the primary health care (PHC) system. In 2005, the Ministry of Health (MOH) began an effort to use HIV/AIDS treatment and care resources as a means to strengthen their PHC system. The MOH worked closely with a number of NGOs to integrate HIV programs more effectively into existing public-sector PHC services. CASE DESCRIPTION: In 2005, the Ministry of Health and Health Alliance International initiated an effort in two provinces to integrate ART into the existing primary health care system through health units distributed across 23 districts. Integration included: a) placing ART services in existing units; b) retraining existing workers; c) strengthening laboratories, testing, and referral linkages; e) expanding testing in TB wards; f) integrating HIV and antenatal services; and g) improving district-level management. DISCUSSION: By 2008, treatment was available in nearly 67 health facilities in 23 districts. Nearly 30,000 adults were on ART. Over 80,000 enrolled in the HIV/AIDS program. Loss to follow-up from antenatal and TB testing to ART services has declined from 70% to less than 10% in many integrated sites. Average time from HIV testing to ART initiation is significantly faster and adherence to ART is better in smaller peripheral clinics than in vertical day hospitals. Integration has also improved other non-HIV aspects of primary health care. CONCLUSION: The integration approach enables the public sector PHC system to test more patients for HIV, place more patients on ART more quickly and efficiently, reduce loss-to-follow-up, and achieve greater geographic HIV care coverage compared to the vertical model. Through the integration process, HIV resources have been used to rehabilitate PHC infrastructure (including laboratories and pharmacies), strengthen supervision, fill workforce gaps, and improve patient flow between services and facilities in ways that can benefit all programs. Using aid resources to integrate and better link HIV care with existing services can strengthen wider PHC systems.</td>

      <td>Using vital registration data to update mortality among patients lost to follow-up from ART programmes: evidence from the Themba Lethu Clinic, South Africa.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the rates of mortality in patients lost to follow-up (LTFU) from a large urban public sector HIV clinic in South Africa. METHODS: We compared vital status using the clinic's database to vital status verified against the Vital Registration system at the South African Department of Home Affairs. We compared rates of mortality before and after updating mortality data. Predictors of mortality were estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves and proportional hazard regression. RESULTS: Of the 7097 total patients who initiated highly active antiretroviral therapy at Themba Lethu Clinic by October 1st, 2008 and had an ID number, 6205 were included. 2453 patients (21%) were LTFU, of whom 1037 (42.3%) could be included in the analysis. After matching to the vital registration system, mortality more than doubled from 4.2% (258/6205) to 10.9% (676/6205). Overall 37% of those LTFU died by life-table analysis the probability of survival amongst those LTFU was 69% (95% CI: 66-72%), 64% (95% CI: 61-67%) and 59% (95% CI: 55-62%) by years 1, 2 and 3 since being lost, respectively. Those at highest risk of death after being lost were patients with a history of tuberculosis, CD4 count < 100 cells/microl, BMI < 17.5, haemoglobin < 10 and on <6 months of treatment. CONCLUSION: Mortality was substantially underestimated among patients lost from a South African HIV treatment programme despite limited active tracing. Linking to vital registration systems can provide more accurate assessments of programme effectiveness and target lost patients most at risk for mortality.</td>

      <td>Nevirapine-associated early hepatotoxicity: incidence, risk factors, and associated mortality in a primary care ART programme in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The majority of antiretroviral treatment programmes in sub-Saharan Africa are scaling up antiretroviral treatment using a fixed dose first-line antiretroviral regimen containing stavudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine. One of the primary concerns with the use of this regimen is nevirapine-associated hepatotoxicity. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Study participants were 1809 HIV-infected, antiretroviral naive adults initiating nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy between November 2002 and December 2006. The primary outcome was early hepatotoxicity. Secondary outcomes were associations with hepatotoxicity and mortality at six months. The cumulative proportion of early hepatotoxicity ranged from 1.0-2.0% giving an incidence-rate at 102 days of 3.6-7.6 per 100 person-years. Median time to hepatotoxicity was 32 (IQR 28-58) days. At 12 weeks, only 8% of patients had alanine aminotransferase monitoring at all the time-points recommended by national guidelines. No association was found between age, gender, baseline CD4 count, concurrent tuberculosis infection, prior participation in a prevention of mother-to-child-transmission program, or baseline weight and early hepatotoxicity. There was no association between early hepatotoxicity and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative proportion of early hepatotoxicity in nevirapine based antiretroviral therapy was low in this resource-constrained setting. Hepatotoxicity was not associated with mortality. Frequent routine monitoring of alanine aminotransferase proved difficult to implement in this public sector primary care programme. Focused monitoring in the first month may be a more cost-effective and pragmatic option in settings with limited resources. Correlation with clinical signs and symptoms may allow future alanine aminotransferase testing to be dictated by clinical criteria.</td>

      <td>Effectiveness of non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy in women previously exposed to a single intrapartum dose of nevirapine: a multi-country, prospective cohort study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Intrapartum and neonatal single-dose nevirapine (NVP) reduces the risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission but also induces viral resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) drugs. This drug resistance largely fades over time. We hypothesized that women with a prior single-dose NVP exposure would have no more than a 10% higher cumulative prevalence of failure of their NNRTI-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) over the first 48 wk of therapy than would women without a prior exposure. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We enrolled 355 NVP-exposed and 523 NVP-unexposed women at two sites in Zambia, one site in Kenya, and two sites in Thailand into a prospective, non-inferiority cohort study and followed them for 48 wk on ART. Those who died, discontinued NNRTI-containing ART, or had a plasma viral load >or=400 copies/ml at either the 24 wk or 48 wk study visits and confirmed on repeat testing were characterized as having failed therapy. Overall, 114 of 355 NVP-exposed women (32.1%) and 132 of 523 NVP-unexposed women (25.2%) met criteria for treatment failure. The difference in failure rates between the exposure groups was 6.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8%-13.0%). The failure rates of women stratified by our predefined exposure interval categories were as follows: 47 of 116 women in whom less than 6 mo elapsed between exposure and starting ART failed therapy (40%; p<0.001 compared to unexposed women); 25 of 67 women in whom 7-12 mo elapsed between exposure and starting ART failed therapy (37%; p = 0.04 compared to unexposed women); and 42 of 172 women in whom more than 12 mo elapsed between exposure and starting ART failed therapy (24%; p = 0.82 compared to unexposed women). Locally weighted regression analysis also indicated a clear inverse relationship between virologic failure and the exposure interval. CONCLUSIONS: Prior exposure to single-dose NVP was associated with an increased risk of treatment failure; however, this risk seems largely confined to women with a more recent exposure. Women requiring ART within 12 mo of NVP exposure should not be prescribed an NNRTI-containing regimen as first-line therapy.</td>

      <td>Diagnosis and management of antiretroviral-therapy failure in resource-limited settings in sub-Saharan Africa: challenges and perspectives.</td>
      <td>Despite the enormous progress made in scaling up antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa, many challenges remain, not least of which are the identification and management of patients who have failed first-line therapy. Less than 3% of patients are receiving second-line treatment at present, whereas 15-25% of patients have detectable viral loads 12 months or more into treatment, of whom a substantial proportion might have virological failure. We discuss the reasons why virological ART failure is likely to be under-diagnosed in the routine health system, and address the current difficulties with standard recommended second-line ART regimens. The development of new diagnostic tools for ART failure, in particular a point-of-care HIV viral-load test, combined with simple and inexpensive second-line therapy, such as boosted protease-inhibitor monotherapy, could revolutionise the management of ART failure in resource-limited settings.</td>

      <td>Quality of HIV care provided by non-physician clinicians and physicians in Mozambique: a retrospective cohort study.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: To compare HIV care quality provided by non-physician clinicians (NPC) and physicians. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study assessing the relationship between provider cadre and HIV care quality among non-pregnant adult patients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the national HIV care programme. METHODS: Computerized medical records from patients initiating ART between July 2004 and October 2007 at two HIV public HIV clinics in central Mozambique were used to develop multivariate analyses evaluating differences in process and care continuity measures for patients whose initial provider was a NPC or physician. RESULTS: A total of 5892 patients was included in the study, including 4093 (69.5%) with NPC and 1799 (30.5%) with physicians as initial providers. Those whose initial provider was a NPC were more likely to have a CD4 cell count 90-210 days [risk ratio (RR) 1.13, 1.04<RR<1.23] and 330-390 days (RR 1.12, 0.96<RR<1.31) after initiating ART. A large majority of patients adhered well to care, although patients whose initial provider was a NPC had more frequent clinical visits in the first year post-ART initiation (RR 1.02, 1.00<RR<1.05) and higher levels of adherence to antiretroviral medicines in the first 6 months after initiating ART (RR1.05, 1.02<RR<1.09). Patients of NPC were less likely to be lost to follow-up than those seen by physicians (RR 0.86, 0.73<RR<1.02). CONCLUSION: NPC performance was similar to or better than that of physicians for the HIV care quality study measures. Our results highlight the important role of NPC in scaling up ART in Mozambique, and argue for using all relevant clinical resources to meet the large demands for care in countries with high HIV burdens.</td>

      <td>The high cost of second-line antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS in South Africa.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: The present article estimates the cost and outcomes of second-line antiretroviral therapy. The cost of second-line drugs is generally higher than that of first-line drugs and it is expected that the absolute number of patients on second-line antiretroviral therapy will increase over time. This information is crucial for planning and budgeting. METHODS: Resource utilization and outcome data were extracted for patients who initiated standard second-line therapy. Resource usage was measured from second-line initiation for 12 months and outcomes were determined at 12 months. Unit costs were applied to resource usage using standard costing techniques. Costs were classified into drug, laboratory, visit, and fixed costs. Outcomes at 12 months were determined using attendance status, diagnostic results, and treatment status. Average cost per patient and average cost per outcome were reported. RESULTS: Of the 293 participants in the study cohort, 58% remained in care and responding, 15% were in care but not responding, and 26% were no longer in care. During the 12 months following second-line initiation, the average cost per participant was $1037. Most of the cost per patient was attributable to drugs (71%), 13% to laboratory tests, 10% to clinic and pharmacy visits, and 6% to infrastructure and other fixed costs. Second-line therapy was 2.4 times more expensive per year in care than first-line therapy. CONCLUSION: The gradual increase in second-line numbers that can be expected as treatment programs mature may cause a meaningful increase in the overall average cost per patient treated.</td>

      <td>Studies of factors influencing tuberculosis (TB) care-seeking and treatment adherence in high TB/HIV co-burden African countries have typically surveyed urban patients' sociodemographic characteristics. To understand community perceptions and guide rapid assessment interviews, we interviewed key informants (nurses, tribal leaders, n = 9) and local researchers (n = 3) in poor, rural areas of South Africa. HIV-related stigma and misperceptions about TB causes and symptoms were cited as barriers. Key informants said older people preferred traditional healers; local researchers heard a preference for "western" care and suggested supporting clinic staff travel to remote villages with health education and diagnostic services. Key informants said not understanding the consequences of incomplete treatment and reluctance to relinquish disability grants decreased adherence. All reported that nonfamily DOTS supporters provided invaluable support. Rapid assessment should include drop-outs, re-treated, and co-infected patients and ask questions examining origins of misperceptions, stigma of testing, and pre-test messages to improve community perceptions about TB care-seeking and treatment adherence.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: This study explores reasons for drop-out from pre-ARV care in a resource-poor setting where premature death is a common consequence of delayed ARV initiation. METHODS: In Iganga, Uganda, we conducted key informant interviews with staff at the pre-ARV clinic, focus group discussions with persons who looked after people living with HIV (PLWH) and in-depth interviews with PLWH half of whom had dropped out of pre-ARV care. Content data analysis was done to identify recurrent themes. RESULTS: Reasons cited for dropping out of pre-ARV care include: inadequate post-test counseling due to staff work overload, competition from the holistic and less stigmatizing traditional/spiritual healers. Others were transportation costs, long waiting time lack of incentives to seek pre-ARV care by healthy looking PLWH and gender inequalities. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-ARV adherence counseling should be improved through recruitment of counselors or multi-skilling in counseling skills for the available staff to reduce on the work load. Traditional/ spiritual healers should be integrated and supervised to offer pre-ARV care. Door step supply of cotrimoxazole using agents could reduce transport costs, waiting time and increase access to pre-ARV. Women should be sensitized on comprehensive HIV care through the local media and local leaders to address gender inequalities.</td>

      <td>Routine versus clinically driven laboratory monitoring of HIV antiretroviral therapy in Africa (DART): a randomised non-inferiority trial.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) is often managed without routine laboratory monitoring in Africa; however, the effect of this approach is unknown. This trial investigated whether routine toxicity and efficacy monitoring of HIV-infected patients receiving ART had an important long-term effect on clinical outcomes in Africa. METHODS: In this open, non-inferiority trial in three centres in Uganda and one in Zimbabwe, 3321 symptomatic, ART-naive, HIV-infected adults with CD4 counts less than 200 cells per microL starting ART were randomly assigned to laboratory and clinical monitoring (LCM; n=1659) or clinically driven monitoring (CDM; n=1662) by a computer-generated list. Haematology, biochemistry, and CD4-cell counts were done every 12 weeks. In the LCM group, results were available to clinicians; in the CDM group, results (apart from CD4-cell count) could be requested if clinically indicated and grade 4 toxicities were available. Participants switched to second-line ART after new or recurrent WHO stage 4 events in both groups, or CD4 count less than 100 cells per microL (LCM only). Co-primary endpoints were new WHO stage 4 HIV events or death, and serious adverse events. Non-inferiority was defined as the upper 95% confidence limit for the hazard ratio (HR) for new WHO stage 4 events or death being no greater than 1.18. Analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN13968779. FINDINGS: Two participants assigned to CDM and three to LCM were excluded from analyses. 5-year survival was 87% (95% CI 85-88) in the CDM group and 90% (88-91) in the LCM group, and 122 (7%) and 112 (7%) participants, respectively, were lost to follow-up over median 4.9 years' follow-up. 459 (28%) participants receiving CDM versus 356 (21%) LCM had a new WHO stage 4 event or died (6.94 [95% CI 6.33-7.60] vs 5.24 [4.72-5.81] per 100 person-years; absolute difference 1.70 per 100 person-years [0.87-2.54]; HR 1.31 [1.14-1.51]; p=0.0001). Differences in disease progression occurred from the third year on ART, whereas higher rates of switch to second-line treatment occurred in LCM from the second year. 283 (17%) participants receiving CDM versus 260 (16%) LCM had a new serious adverse event (HR 1.12 [0.94-1.32]; p=0.19), with anaemia the most common (76 vs 61 cases). INTERPRETATION: ART can be delivered safely without routine laboratory monitoring for toxic effects, but differences in disease progression suggest a role for monitoring of CD4-cell count from the second year of ART to guide the switch to second-line treatment.

      <td>Six-month gain in weight, height, and CD4 predict subsequent antiretroviral treatment responses in HIV-infected South African children.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: Construct percentile curves for 6-month gain in weight, height, CD4 cell count, and CD4 percentage (CD4%) in children initiating ART, and to assess the association between lower percentiles and subsequent ART responses. DESIGN: Cohort of 1394 HIV-infected children initiating ART between April 2004 and March 2008, Johannesburg, South Africa METHODS: The generalized additive model for location, scale, and shape was used to construct percentile curves for 6-month gain in weight, height, CD4 cell count, and CD4%. Cox proportional models were used to assess the association between lower percentiles of each distribution and death, virological suppression, and treatment failure between 6 to 36 months post-ART initiation. RESULTS: Lower percentiles for gain in weight, CD4, and CD4% count after 6 months of ART, but not height, were associated with poor subsequent treatment outcomes independent of baseline characteristics, with increasing strength of association as percentiles decreased. Age-specific 6-month post-ART weight gain in our cohort was substantially higher compared with 6-month weight gain in non-HIV-infected American children of the Fels Institute cohort and the attained weight-for-age at 6 months post-ART plotted on WHO weight-for-age growth charts were not associated with subsequent treatment outcomes. CONCLUSION: Gain in CD4% in the first 6 months of ART was the best predictor of poor subsequent ART outcomes. In areas with limited access to CD4%, weight gain post-ART using our newly developed reference distributions for HIV-infected children on ART is a good alternative to CD4%, and clearly superior to the commonly used 'Road-to-Health' weight-for-age charts.</td>

      <td>Antiretroviral treatment changes in adults from Cote d'Ivoire: the roles of tuberculosis and pregnancy.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To determine the rates and causes of first antiretroviral treatment changes in HIV-infected adults in Cote d'Ivoire. METHODS: We evaluated adults who initiated antiretroviral treatment in an outpatient clinic in Abidjan. We recorded baseline and follow-up data, including drug prescriptions and reasons for changing to alternative first-line regimens (drug substitution for any reason but failure) or second-line regimens (switch for failure). RESULTS: Two thousand and twelve HIV-infected adults (73% women) initiated antiretroviral treatment. At baseline, 9% of all patients were on treatment for tuberculosis and 3% of women were pregnant. First-line antiretroviral treatment consisted of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (58% stavudine-lamivudine, 42% zidovudine-lamivudine) and efavirenz (63%), nevirapine (32%) or indinavir (5%). Median follow-up time was 16.9 months. During this time, 205 (10%) patients died and 261 (13%) were lost to follow-up. Overall, the rate of treatment modifications was 20.7/100 patient-years. The most common modifications were drug substitutions for intolerance (12.4/100 patient-years), pregnancy (4.5/100 patient-years) and tuberculosis (2.5/100 patient-years). The rates of intolerance-related substitutions were 17.9/100 patient-years for stavudine, 6.3/100 patient-years for nevirapine, 3.9/100 patient-years for zidovudine and 0.1/100 patient-years for efavirenz. Twenty percent of efavirenz substitutions resulted from pregnancy and 18% of nevirapine substitutions were related to tuberculosis treatment. CONCLUSION: During the first months following antiretroviral treatment initiation, a third of all treatment changes occurred for reasons other than intolerance to the drug or treatment failure. In Africa, drug forecasting is crucial to ensuring the success of HIV treatment programmes. Drugs that do not require interruptions during pregnancy or tuberculosis treatment should be made more readily available as first-line drugs in sub-Saharan Africa.</td>

      <td>Affordable in-house antiretroviral drug resistance assay with good performance in non-subtype B HIV-1.</td>
      <td>The introduction of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in resource-poor settings is effective in suppressing HIV-1 replication and prolonging life of infected individuals. This has led to a demand for affordable HIV-1 drug resistance assays, since treatment failure due to development of drug resistance is common. This study developed and evaluated an affordable "in-house" genotyping assay to monitor HIV-1 drug resistance in Africa, particularly South Africa. An "in-house" assay using automated RNA extraction, and subtype C specific PCR and sequencing primers was developed and successfully evaluated 396 patient samples (viral load ranges 1000-1.6 million RNA copies/ml). The "in-house" assay was validated by comparing sequence data and drug resistance profiles from 90 patient and 10 external quality control samples to data from the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping kit. The "in-house" assay was more efficient, amplifying all 100 samples, compared to 91 samples using Viroseq. The "in house" sequences were 99.2% homologous to the ViroSeq sequences, and identical drug resistance mutation profiles were observed in 96 samples. Furthermore, the "in-house" assay genotyped 260 of 295 samples from seven African sites, where 47% were non-subtype C. Overall, the newly validated "in-house" drug resistance assay is suited for use in Africa as it overcomes the obstacle of subtype diversity.</td>

      <td>HIV coinfection in multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis results in high early mortality.</td>
      <td>RATIONALE: The multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) epidemics are rapidly expanding in South Africa. Our initial report of HIV-associated XDR TB in South Africa revealed rapid and near complete mortality. Lower mortality has been described in the literature, but few of these patients have been HIV coinfected. OBJECTIVES: To characterize mortality from MDR and XDR TB in a setting with high HIV-coinfection rates. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study among 654 MDR and XDR TB cases diagnosed in Tugela Ferry, South Africa, from 2005 to 2007. Demographics and HIV status were abstracted from available medical records. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Survival was determined from the date of sputum collection until October 2008 and correlated with year of diagnosis and drug-susceptibility test results. From 2005 to 2007, 272 MDR TB and 382 XDR TB cases were diagnosed; HIV-coinfection rates were 90 and 98%, respectively. One-year mortality was 71% for MDR and 83% for XDR TB patients; 40% of MDR TB and 51% of XDR TB cases died within 30 days of sputum collection. One-year mortality among both MDR and XDR TB patients improved from 2005 to 2007; however, the majority of deaths still occurred within the first 30 days. One-year and 30-day mortality rates were worse with greater degree of drug resistance (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality from MDR and XDR TB in this high HIV-prevalence region is extraordinarily high, particularly within the first 30 days. Efforts to reduce mortality must focus on earlier diagnosis and early initiation of second-line TB and antiretroviral therapy.</td>

      <td>Varied patterns of HIV-1 drug resistance on failing first-line antiretroviral therapy in South Africa.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The South African national antiretroviral therapy roll-out program is entering its sixth year, with over 570,000 adults accessing treatment. HIV-1 drug resistance is a potential consequence of therapy. This study determined the pattern of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations after failure of first-line treatment regimens in South Africa. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-six patients virologically failing first-line regimens were studied to determine resistance patterns. RESULTS: The most common reverse transcriptase mutation was M184V/I (72%; n = 163); 11% of patients (n = 25) had only nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations and 17% (n = 38) had no known resistance mutations. The K65R mutation was detected in 4%. The frequency of thymidine analog mutations was significantly higher with azidothymidine-containing (31 of 57) than stavudine-containing regimens (39 of 169; P < 0.001). The Y181C mutation was more frequent with failure of nevirapine (NVP)-containing (26%) than efavirenz (EFV)-containing therapy (3%; P < 0.001). The V106M mutation was more frequent with EFV (30%) than NVP (4%; P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: HIV-1 drug resistance patterns varied broadly after failure of first-line therapy, ranging from no known resistance mutations (17%) to multinucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and NNRTI resistance (23%). NNRTI mutation profiles differed for patients on EFV- compared with NVP-containing regimens. Overall, these findings suggest that HIV-1 drug resistance testing would be useful in identifying most appropriate second-line regimens.</td>

      <td>Understanding reasons for and outcomes of patients lost to follow-up in antiretroviral therapy programs in Africa through a sampling-based approach.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: Losses to follow-up after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are common in Africa and are a considerable obstacle to understanding the effectiveness of nascent treatment programs. We sought to characterize, through a sampling-based approach, reasons for and outcomes of patients who become lost to follow-up. DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: We searched for and interviewed a representative sample of lost patients or close informants in the community to determine reasons for and outcomes among lost patients. RESULTS: Three thousand six hundred twenty-eight HIV-infected adults initiated ART between January 1, 2004 and September 30, 2007 in Mbarara, Uganda. Eight hundred twenty-nine became lost to follow-up (cumulative incidence at 1, 2, and 3 years of 16%, 30%, and 39%). We sought a representative sample of 128 lost patients in the community and ascertained vital status in 111 (87%). Top reasons for loss included lack of transportation or money and work/child care responsibilities. Among the 111 lost patients who had their vital status ascertained through tracking, 32 deaths occurred (cumulative 1-year incidence 36%); mortality was highest shortly after the last clinic visit. Lower pre-ART CD4 T-cell count, older age, low blood pressure, and a central nervous system syndrome at the last clinic visit predicted deaths. Of patients directly interviewed, 83% were in care at another clinic and 71% were still using ART. CONCLUSIONS: Sociostructural factors are the primary reasons for loss to follow-up. Outcomes among the lost are heterogeneous: both deaths and transfers to other clinics were common. Tracking a sample of lost patients is an efficient means for programs to understand site-specific reasons for and outcomes among patients lost to follow-up.</td>

      <td>Sustainability of first-line antiretroviral regimens: findings from a large HIV treatment program in western Kenya.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: To describe first change or discontinuation in combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) among previously treatment naive, HIV-infected adults in a resource-constrained setting. METHODS: The United States Agency for International Development-Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare Partnership has enrolled >90,000 HIV-infected patients at 18 clinics throughout western Kenya. Patients in this analysis were aged > or =18 years, previously antiretroviral treatment naive, and initiated to cART between January 2006 and November 2007, with at least 1 follow-up visit. A treatment change or discontinuation was defined as change of regimen including single drug substitutions or a complete halting of cART. RESULTS: There were 14,162 patients eligible for analysis and 10,313 person-years of follow-up, of whom 1376 changed or stopped their cART. Among these, 859 (62%) changed their regimen (including 514 patients who had a single drug substitution) and 517 (38%) completely discontinued cART. The overall incidence rate (IR) of cART changes or stops per 100 person-years was 13.3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 12.7-14.1]. The incidence was much higher in the first year of post-cART initiation (IR: 25.0, 95% CI: 23.6-26.3) compared with the second year (IR: 2.4, 95% CI: 2.0-2.8). The most commonly cited reason was toxicity (46%). In multivariate regression, individuals were more likely to discontinue cART if they were World Health Organization stage III/IV [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR): 1.37, 95% CI: 1.11-1.69] or were receiving a zidovudine-containing regimen (AHR: 4.44, 95% CI: 3.35-5.88). Individuals were more likely to change their regimen if they were aged > or =38 years (AHR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.23-1.69), had to travel more than 1 hour to clinic (AHR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.15-1.57), had a CD4 at cART initiation < or =111 cells/mm3 (AHR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.29-1.77), or had been receiving a zidovudine-containing regimen (AHR: 3.73, 95% CI: 2.81-4.95). Those attending urban clinics and those receiving stavudine-containing regimens were less likely to experience either a discontinuation or a change of their cART. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a moderate incidence of cART changes and discontinuations among this large population of adults in western Kenya. Mostly occurring within 12 months of cART initiation, and primarily due to toxicity, older individuals, those with more advanced disease, and those using zidovudine are at higher risk of experiencing a change or a discontinuation in their cART.</td>

      <td>Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) is essential in HIV/AIDS control. We analysed 2000-05 data from mother-infant pairs in our PMTCT programme in rural Uganda, examining programme utilization and outcomes, HIV transmission rates and predictors of death or loss to follow-up (LFU). Out of 19,017 women, 1,037 (5.5%) attending antenatal care services tested HIV positive. Of these, 517 (50%) enrolled in the PMTCT programme and gave birth to 567 infants. Before tracing, 303 (53%) mother-infant pairs were LFU. Reasons for dropout were infant death and lack of understanding of importance of follow-up. Risk of death or LFU was higher among infants with no or incomplete intrapartum prophylaxis (OR = 1.90, 95% CI 1.07-3.36) and of weaning age <6 months (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.42-4.58), and lower in infants with diagnosed acute illness (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.16-0.55). Mother-to-child HIV cumulative transmission rate was 8.3%, and 15.5% when HIV-related deaths were considered. Improved tracking of HIV-exposed infants is needed in PMTCT programmes where access to early infant diagnosis is still limited.</td>
